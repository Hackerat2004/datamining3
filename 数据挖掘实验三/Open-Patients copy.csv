Comparative studies with ifosfamide on the immuno-labile DS carcinosarcoma. Stimulation of the autoimmune activity for approx. 20 days by BA 1, a N-(2-cyanoethylene)-urea. Novel prophylactic possibilities].. A report is given on the recent discovery of outstanding immunological properties in BA 1 [N-(2-cyanoethylene)-urea] having a (low) molecular mass M = 111.104. Experiments in 214 DS carcinosarcoma bearing Wistar rats have shown that BA 1, at a dosage of only about 12 percent LD50 (150 mg kg) and negligible lethality (1.7 percent), results in a recovery rate of 40 percent without hyperglycemia and, in one test, of 80 percent with hyperglycemia. Under otherwise unchanged conditions the reference substance ifosfamide (IF) -- a further development of cyclophosphamide -- applied without hyperglycemia in its most efficient dosage of 47 percent LD50 (150 mg kg) brought about a recovery rate of 25 percent at a lethality of 18 percent. (Contrary to BA 1, 250-min hyperglycemia caused no further improvement of the recovery rate.) However this comparison is characterized by the fact that both substances exhibit two quite different (complementary) mechanisms of action. Leucocyte counts made after application of the said cancerostatics and dosages have shown a pronounced stimulation with BA 1 and with ifosfamide, the known suppression in the post-therapeutic interval usually found with standard cancerostatics. In combination with the cited plaque test for BA 1, blood pictures then allow conclusions on the immunity status. Since IF can be taken as one of the most efficient cancerostatics--there is no other chemotherapeutic known up to now that has a more significant effect on the DS carcinosarcoma in rats -- these findings are of special importance. Finally, the total amount of leucocytes and lymphocytes as well as their time behaviour was determined from the blood picture of tumour-free rats after i.v. application of BA 1. The thus obtained numerical values clearly show that further research work on the prophylactic use of this substance seems to be necessary and very promising."}

The distribution of blood flow to the subendocardial, medium and subepicardial layers of the left ventricular free wall was studied in anaesthetized dogs under normoxic (A), hypoxic (B) conditions and under pharmacologically induced (etafenone) coronary vasodilation (C). Regional myocardial blood flow was determined by means of the particle distribution method. In normoxia a transmural gradient of flow was observed, with the subendocardial layers receiving a significantly higher flow rate compared with the subepicardial layers. In hypoxia induced vasodilation this transmural gradient of flow was persistent. In contrast a marked redistribution of regional flow was observed under pharmacologically induced vasodilation. The transmural gradient decreased. In contrast to some findings these experiments demonstrate that a considerable vasodilatory capacity exists in all layers of the myocardium and can be utilized by drugs. The differences observed for the intramural distribution pattern of flow under hypoxia and drug induced vasodilation support the hypothesis that this pattern reflects corresponding gradients of regional myocardial metabolism."}

RMI 61 140, RMI 61 144 and RMI 61 280 are newly synthetized N-[8-R-dibenzo(b,f)oxepin-10-yl]-N'-methyl-piperazine-maleates which show interesting psychopharmacologic effects. This work contains the results of a study performed with these three compounds, in order to demonstrate their neuropsycholeptic activity in comparison with chloropromazine (CPZ) and chlordiazepoxide (CPD). The inhibition of motility observed in mice shows that the compounds reduce the normal spontaneous motility as well as the muscle tone. The central-depressant activity is evidenced by increased barbiturate-induced sleep and a remarkable eyelid ptosis can also be observed. Our compounds do not show any activity on electroshock just as do CPZ and CPD. As to the antipsychotic outline, our compounds show strong reduction of lethality due to amphetamine in grouped mice and a strong antiapomorphine activity. They show also an antiaggressive effect and an inhibitory activity on avoidance behaviour much stronger than CPZ. We have also found extrapyramidal effects, as catalepsy, common to many tranquillizers of the kind of the standards used by us. As for vegetative phenomena, the compounds show hypotensive dose related action ranging from moderate to strong, probably due to an a-receptor inhibition. Adrenolytic activity against lethal doses of adrenaline, antiserotonin and antihistaminic effects, as well as other actions (hypothermia, analgesia, etc.) confirm that RMI 61 140, RMI 61 144 and RMI 61 280 are endowed with pharmacologic properties similar and more potent than those of CPZ. Studies on the metabolism of brain catecholamines show that they are similar to CPZ, although with less effect on dopamine level."}

A double-blind study with intra-individual comparisons was carried out to investigate the effects of 15 mg of (8r)-3alpha-hydroxy-8-isopropyl-1alphaH-tropanium bromide(+/-)-tropate (Sch 1000), 15 mg Sch 1000 + 10 mg oxazepam, 10 mg oxazepam and placebo with oral administration in randomized sequence on gastric juice volume, amount of acid, concentration and pH values in 12 healthy volunteers. The secretion parameters were measured during a 1-h basal period and a 2-h stimulation period. The gastric juice was obtained in 15 min portions via stomach tube. Stimulation was effected by 1 mug/kg/h pentagastrin via drip infusion. The Friedman test was used for the comparative statistical evaluation, and individual comparisons were carried out by means of the Wilcoxon test (pair-differences rank). The results show that Sch 1000 and Sch 1000 + oxazepam were equal in effect on basal and stimulated secretion volume. As compared with placebo, it was not possible to establish an effect on secretion volume for oxazepam alone. Sch 1000 and Sch 1000 + oxazepam were found to be equipotent in reducing the amount of basal acid, while oxazepam reduced this quantity only during the first 30 min of basal secretion. None of the three active preparations was capable of inhibiting the stimulated acid, although both Sch 1000 preparations produced a clear trend towards lowered mean values. During the basal secretion period, all three test preparations had an inhibiting action on acid concentration, but none of them had a significant effect during the stimulation period. The pH value was savely increased only by Sch 1000 and Sch 1000 + oxazepam, and this even only during the basal period. The results are discussed."}

Stromata and peaks also induce lysis of PNH-like cells in unacidified serum, indicating activation of complement through the alternate pathway. This is confirmed by immunoelectrophoretic observation.

The rate of disappearance of dried grass during incubation in the rumens of sheep receiving either whole or pelleted barley was studied in a second experiment. After 24 h incubation only 423 mg/g incubated had disappeared in the rumen of sheep receiving pelleted barley while 625 mg/g incubated had disappeared when it was incubated in the rumen of sheep receiving whole barley. 3. The voluntary intake of dried grass of lambs was studied in a third experiment when they received supplements of either 25 or 50 g whole or pelleted barley/kg live weight 0-75. At the high level, pelleted barley reduced intake of dried grass by 534 g/kg but whole barley reduced it by only 352 g/kg. The digestibility of acid-detergent fibre was reduced more by pelleted barley than by whole barley but there was a tendency for a small increase in digestibility of the barley due to processing. 4.

Poly(8-aminoguanylic acid) has in neutral solution a novel ordered structure of high stability. The 8-amino group permits formation of three hydrogen bonds between two residues along the \"top\", or long axis, of the purines. The usual hydrogen bonding protons and Watson-Crick pairing sites are not involved in the association. The bonding scheme has a twofold rotation axis and is hemiprotonated at N(7). Poly(8NH2G) is converted by alkaline titration (pK = 9.7) to a quite different ordered structure, which is the favored form over the range approximately pH 10-11. The bonding scheme appears to be composed of a planar, tetrameric array of guanine residues, in which the 8-amino group does not participate in interbase hydrogen bonding. Poly (8NH2G) does not interact with poly(C) in neutral solution because of the high stability of the hemiprotonated G-G self-structure. Titration to the alkaline plateau, however, permits ready formation of a two-stranded Watson-Crick helix. In contrast to the monomer 8NH2GMP, poly(8NH2G) does not form a triple helix with poly(C) under any conditions. The properties of the ordered structures are interpreted in terms of a strong tendency of the 8-amino group to form a third interbase hydrogen bond, when this possibility is not prevented by high pH."}
{"_id": "38", "description": "Effect of pH on substrate and inhibitor kinetic constants of human liver alanine aminopeptidase. Evidence for two ionizable active center groups.. The presence of at least two ionizable active center groups has been detected by a study of the effect of pH upon catalysis of hydrolysis of L-alanyl-beta-naphthylamide by human liver alanine aminopeptidase and upon the inhibition of hydrolysis by inhibitors and substrate analogs. Octanoic acid, octylamine, and peptide inhibitors have been found to be competitive inhibitors and are therefore thought to bind the active center. L-Phe was previously shown to bind the active center since it was found to be a competitive inhibitor of the hydrolysis of tripeptide substrates (Garner, C. W., and Behal, F. J. (1975), Biochemistry 14, 3208). A plot of pKm vs. pH for the substrate L-Ala-beta-naphthylamide showed that binding decreased below pH 5.9 and above 7.5, the points at which the theoretical curve undergoes an integral change in slope. These points are interpreted as the pKa either of substrate ionizable groups or binding-dependent enzyme active center groups. Similar plots of pKm vs. pH for L-alanyl-p-nitroanilide (as substrate) and pKi vs. pH for L-Leu-L-Leu-L-Leu and D-Leu-L-Tyr (as inhibitors) gave pairs fo pKa values of 5.8 and 7.4, 6.0 and 7.5, and 5.7 and 7.5, respectively. All the above substrates (and D-Leu-L-Tyr) have pKa values near 7.5; therefore, the binding-dependent group with a pKa value near 7.5 is possibly this substrate group. Similar plots of pKi vs. pH for the inhibitors L-Phe, L-Met, L-Leu, octylamine, and octanoic acid had only one bending point at 7.7, 7.6, 7.4, 6.3, and 5.9, respectively. Amino acid inhibitors, octylamine, and octanoic acid have no groups with pKa values between 5 and 9. These data indicate that there are two active center ionizable groups with pKa values of approximately 6.0 and 7.5 which are involved in substrate binding or inhibitory amino acid binding but not in catalysis since Vmax was constant at all pH values tested."}
{"_id": "39", "description": "Formation of transient complexes in the glutamate dehydrogenase catalyzed reaction.. The reaction of glutamate dehydrogenase and glutamate (gl) with NAD+ and NADP+ has been studied with stopped-flow techniques. The enzyme was in all experiments present in excess of the coenzyme. The results indicate that the ternary complex (E-NAD(P)H-kg) is present as an intermediate in the formation of the stable complex (E-NAD(P)H-gl). The identification of the complexes is based on their absorption spectra. The binding of the coenzyme to (E-gl) is the rate-limiting step in the formation of (E-NAD(P)H-kg) while the dissociation of alpha-ketoglutarate (kg) from this complex is the rate-limiting step in the formation of (E-NAD(P)H-gl). The Km for glutamate was 20-25 mM in the first reaction and 3 mM in the formation of the stable complex. The Km values were independent of the coenzyme. The reaction rates with NAD+ were approximately 50% greater than those with NADP+. Furthermore, high glutamate concentration inhibited the formation of (E-NADH-kg) while no substrate inhibition was found with NADP+ as coenzyme. ADP enhanced while GTP reduced the rate of (E-NAD(P)H-gl) formation. The rate of formation of (E-NAD(P)H-kg) was inhibited by ADP, while it increased at high glutamate concentration when small amounts of GTP were added. The results show that the higher activity found with NAD+ compared to NADP+ under steady-state assay conditions do not necessarily involve binding of NAD+ to the ADP activating site of the enzyme. Moreover, the substrate inhibition found at high glutamate concentration under steady-state assay condition is not due to the formation of (E-NAD(P)H-gl) as this complex is formed with Km of 3 mM glutamate, and the substrate inhibition is only significant at 20-30 times this concentration."}

{"_id": "41", "description": "Stabilization of the globular structure of ferricytochrome c by chloride in acidic solvents.. Increasing concentrations of chloride were found to increase the resolution between two visible absorbance spectral transitions associated with acidification of ferricytochrome c. Analysis of a variety of spectral and viscosity measurements indicates that protonation of a single group having an apparent pK of 2.1 +/- 0.2 and an intrinsic pK of about 5.3 displaces the methionine ligand without significantly perturbing the native globular conformation. Analysis of methylated ferricytochrome c suggests that protonation of a carboxylate ion, most likely a heme propionate residue, is responsible for displacement of the methionine ligand. Addition of a proton to a second group having an apparent pK of 1.2 +/- 0.1 displaces the histidine ligand and unfolds the protein from a globular conformation into a random coil. It is most likely that the second protonation occurs on the imidazole ring of the histidine ligand itself. Chloride is proposed to perturb these transitions by ligation in the fifth coordination position of the heme ion. Such ligation stabilizes a globular conformation of ferricytochrome c at pH 0.0 and 25 degrees."}

The properties of the functional groups in a protein can be used as built-in-probes of the structure of the protein. We have developed a general procedure whereby the ionization constant and chemical reactivity of solitary functional groups in proteins may be determined. The method may be applied to the side chain of histidine, tyrosine, lysine, and cysteine, as well as to the amino terminus of the protein. The method, which is an extension of the competitive labeling technique using [3H]- and [14C]1-fluoro-2,4-dinitrobenzene (N2ph-F) in a double-labeling procedure, is rapid and sensitive. Advantage is taken of the fact that after acid hydrolysis of a dinitrophenylated protein, a derivative is obtained which must be derived from a unique position in the protein. The method has been applied to the solitary histidine residue of lysozyme, alpha-lytic protease, and Streptomyces griseus (S.G.) trypsin, as well as to the amino terminus of the latter protein. The following parameters were obtained for reaction with N2ph-F at 20 degrees C in 0.1 N KCl: the histidine of hen egg-white lysozyme, pKa of 6.4 and second-order velocity constant of 0.188 M-1 min-1; the histidine of alpha-lytic protease, pKa of 6.5 and second-order velocity constant of 0.0235 M-1 min-1; the histidine of S.G. trypsin, pKa of 6.5 and second-order velocity constant of 0.0328 M-1 min-1; the valyl amino terminus of S.G. trypsin, pKa of 8.1 and second-order velocity constant of 0.403 M-1 min-1.

Guanidine and substituted guanidines react with 2,4-pentanedione to form N-substituted 2-amino-4,6-dimethylpyrimidines at a rate which is lower by at least a factor of 20 than the rate of reaction of 2,4-pentanedione with primary amines. Selective modification of lysine and arginine side chains in proteins can readily be achieved with 2,4-pentanedione. Modification of lysine is favored by reaction at pH 7 or for short reaction times at pH 9. Selective modification of arginine is achieved by reaction with 2,4-pentanedione for long times at pH 9, followed by treatment of the protein with hydroxylamine. The extent of modification of lysine and arginine side chains can readily be measured spectrophotometrically. Modification of lysozyme with 2,4-pentanedione at pH 7 results in modification of 3.8 lysine residues and less than 0.4 arginine residue in 24 hr. Modification of lysozyme with 2,4-pentanedione at pH 9 results in modification of 4 lysine residues and 4.5 arginine residues in 100 hr.

{"_id": "44", "description": "The origin of the alkaline inactivation of pepsinogen.. Above pH 8.5, pepsinogen is converted into a form which cannot be activated to pepsin on exposure to low pH. Intermediate exposure to neutral pH, however, returns the protein to a form which can be activated. Evidence is presented for a reversible, small conformational change in the molecule, distinct from the unfolding of the protein. At the same time, the molecule is converted to a form of limited solubility, which is precipitated at low pH, where activation is normally seen. The results are interpreted in terms of the peculiar structure of the pepsinogen molecule. Titration of the basic NH2-terminal region produced an open form, which can return to the native form at neutral pH, but which is maintained at low pH by neutralization of carboxylate groups in the pepsin portion."}

A purification procedure is reported for obtaining bovine liver dihydrofolate reductase in high yield and amounts of 100-200 mg. A key step in the procedure is the use of an affinity gel prepared by coupling pteroyl-L-lysine to Sepharose. The purified reductase has a specific activity of about 100 units/mg and is homogeneous as judged by analytical ultracentrifugation, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and titration with methotrexate. The products of the first step of Edman degradation indicated a minimum purity of 79%. The reductase has a molecular weight of about 21500 on the basis of amino acid composition and 22100 +/- 300 from equilibrium sedimentation. It is not inhibited by antiserum to the Streptococcus faecium reductase (isoenzyme 2). Unlike the reductase of many other vertebrate tissues, the bovine enzyme is inhibited by mercurials rather than activated and it has a single pH optimum at both low and high ionic strength. However, the position of the pH optimum is shifted and the activity increased by increasing ionic strength. Automatic Edman degradation has been used to determine 34 of the amino-terminal 37 amino acid residues. Considerable homology exists between this region and the corresponding regions of the reductase from S. faecium and from Escherichia coli. This strengthens the idea that this region contributes to the structure of the binding site for dihydrofolate."}

Determinations of the molecular weight of the enzyme based on its amino acid composition, sedimentation velocity, and sodium dodecyl sulfate gel electrophoresis gave values of 17680, 17470 and 18300, respectively. An aggregated form of the enzyme with a low specific activity can be separated from the monomer by gel filtration; treatment of the aggregate with mercaptoethanol or dithiothreitol results in an increase in enzymic activity and a regeneration of the monomer. Also, multiple molecular forms of the monomer have been detected by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The unresolved enzyme exhibits two pH optima (pH 4.5 and pH 7.0) with dihydrofolate as a substrate. Highest activities are observed in buffers containing large organic cations. In 100 mM imidazolium chloride (pH 7), the specific activity is 47 mumol of dihydrofolate reduced per min per mg at 30 degrees. Folic acid also serves as a substrate with a single pH optimum of pH 4.5. At this pH the Km for folate is 16 muM, and the Vmax is 1/1000 of the rate observed with dihydrofolate as the substrate. Monovalent cations (Na+, K+, Rb+, and Cs+) inhibit dihydrofolate reductase; at a given ionic strength the degree of inhibition is a function of the ionic radius of the cation. Divalent cations are more potent inhibitors; the I50 of BaCl2 is 250 muM, as compared to 125 mM for KCl. Anions neither inhibit nor activate the enzyme."}
{"_id": "47", "description": "The influence of pH on the interaction of inhibitors with triosephosphate isomerase and determination of the pKa of the active-site carboxyl group.. Ionization effects on the binding of the potential transition state analogues 2-phosphoglycolate and 2-phosphoglycolohydroxamate appear to be attributable to the changing state of ionization of the ligands themselves, therefore it is unnecessary to postulate the additional involvement of an ionizing residue at the active site of triosephosphate isomerase to explain the influence of changing pH on Ki in the neutral range. The binding of the competitive inhibitor inorganic sulfate is insensitive to changing pH in the neutral range. 3-Chloroacetol sulfate, synthesized as an active-site-specific reagent for triosephosphate isomerase, is used to provide an indication of the pKa of the essential carboxyl group of this enzyme. Previously described active-site-specific reagents for the isomerase were phosphate esters, and their changing state of ionization (accompanied by possible changes in their affinity for the active site) may have complicated earlier attempts to determine the pKa of the essential carboxyl group from the pH dependence of the rate of inactivation. Being a strong monoprotic acid, chloroacetol sulfate is better suited to the determination of the pKa of the carboxyl group. Chloroacetol sulfate inactivates triosephosphate isomerase by the selective esterification of the same carboxyl group as that which is esterified by the phosphate esters described earlier. From the pH dependence of the rate of inactivation of yeast triosephosphate isomerase, the apparent pKa of the active-site carboxyl group is estimated as 3.9 +/- 0.1."}

Competitive inhibition was produced by these anions. One anion was bound per enzyme molecule, and except in the case of fluoride all of the anions appeared to bind at the same site. Cyanide ion produced a much more effective inhibition of renal dipeptidase than the other monoanions, and it was shown that two cyanide ions were bound per enzyme molecule. An investigation of the effect of pH upon monoanion inhibition suggested that the anion inhibitors bind to the group with a pK of approximately 7.8. Complete dissociation of this group (approximately pH 8.4) eliminates the inhibitory effect of anions. The 35Cl line broadening produced by renal dipeptidase in 0.5 M NaCl solutions was 100 times more effective than that produced by equivalent concentrations of aquozinc(II). The line broadening was dependent upon the concentration of the metalloenzyme and independent of the frequency of the exciting radiation. When zinc ion was removed from the metalloenzyme by dialysis or when chloride was titrated from the metalloenzyme by cyanide, line broadening was decreased. Treatment of renal dipeptidase with saturating concentrations of the competitive inhibitor, guanosine triphosphate, in the presence of 0.5 M NaCl also produced a significant decrease in the 35Cl line width. The 35Cl line broadening produced by renal dipeptidase was shown to decrease with increasing pH through the range pH 5.8-10.8. This line-width variation with pH appeared to result from the titration of a site on the metalloprotein with an approximate pK of 7.4. Temperature studies of 35Cl line broadening by the metalloenzyme in the presence of chloride and cyanide inhibitors suggest that the fast exchange process pertains and that the dominant relaxation mechanism is quadrupolar in nature."}
{"_id": "49", "description": "The interaction of bovine erythrocyte superoxide dismutase with hydrogen peroxide: inactivation of the enzyme.. Bovine erythrocyte superoxide dismutase was slowly and irreversibly inactivated by hydrogen peroxide. The rate of this inactivation was directly dependent upon the concentrations of both H2O2 and of enzyme, and its second-order rate constant at pH 10.0 and 25 degrees was 6.7 M-1 sec-1. Inactivation was preceded by a bleaching due to rapid reduction of Cu2+ on the enzyme, and following this there was a gradual reappearance of a new absorption in the visible region, which was coincident with the loss of catalytic activity. Inactivation of the enzyme was pH-dependent and indicated an essential ionization whose pKa was approximately 10.2. Replacement of H2O by D2O raised this pKa but did not diminish the catalytic activity of superoxide dismutase, measured at pH 10.0. Several compounds, including xanthine, urate, formate, and azide, protected the enzyme against inactivation by H2O2. Alcohols and benzoate, which scavenge hydroxyl radical, did not protect. Compounds with special affinity for singlet oxygen were similarly ineffective. The data were interpreted in terms of the reduction of the enzyme-bound Cu2+ to Cu+, by H2O2, followed by a Fenton's type reaction of the Cu+ with additional H2O2. This would generate Cu2+-OH- or its ionized equivalent, Cu2+-O--, which could then oxidatively attack an adjacent histidine and thus inactivate the enzyme. Compounds which protected the enzyme could have done so by reacting with the bound oxidant, in competition with the adjacent histidine."}

The near-ultraviolet circular dichroism (CD) of three homogeneous anti-type III pneumococcal antibodies in the absence and the presence of the specific hexasaccharide ligand was studied. In addition recombinations and hybridizations of H and L chains derived from two of these antibodies were carried out and the CD spectra of bound and free reconstituted IgG molecules were measured. The results indicate that the CD spectra of the native antibodies in the 260-310-nm range are very similar in shape and sign and exhibit a positive band at 285 nm. The homologous reconstituted antibody molecules exhibited CD spectra very similar in shape and sign to those of the native antibody molecules although recombinant molecules are no longer stabilized by interchain disulfide bonds. Upon addition of the hexasaccharide ligand, a significant decrease in amplitude of the CD spectra (18-21%) occurred in all three native antibodies and their Fab fragments as well as in the homologous recombinant molecules. No CD spectral changes could be detected upon interaction of the hapten ligand with the heterologous recombinants. All homogeneous antibodies studied exhibited fluorescence quenching upon oligosaccharide binding and a blue shift of the emission maximum. This property allowed the determination of the binding constant of one selected antibody to be made. Taken together, CD and fluorescence spectroscopic data suggest that oligosaccharide ligands induced detectable conformational changes in the Fab fragment of the antibody."}
{"_id": "51", "description": "Conformational changes induced in a homogeneous anti-type III pneumococcal antibody by oligosaccharides of increasing size.. The circular polarization of luminescence (CPL) emitted by tryptophan residues was used as a sensitive probe for measuring ligand-induced structural changes in a homogeneous type III pneumococcal antibody. A series of oligosaccharide ligands of increasing size derived from type III polysaccharide by partial acid hydrolysis was assayed. Ligand-induced changes in the circular polarization of fluorescence of the antibody were observed for all antigens tested, including tetra-, hexa-, and octasaccharides and a 16-residue oligomer, the largest changes being recorded upon interaction with the intact soluble type III pneumococcal (SIII) polysaccharide. When Fab' or F(ab')2 fragments were used instead of the antibody IgG for binding of SIII polysaccharide, the extent of conformational changes was decreased. This suggests interactions between Fab and Fc portions in the IgG molecule and subsequent conformational changes in Fc part upon antigen binding. Reduction of interchain disulfide bonds abolished the additional spectral changes attributed to the Fc part but not the changes observed in the Fab part, thus suggesting that the presence of the interchain disulfide bond in the hinge region is required for maximal CPL changes to occur. Small monovalent ligands, i.e., the tetra-, hexa-, and octasaccharides, were capable of inducing CPL changes in the Fab part of the antibody molecule as well as CPL changes attributed to the Fc portion. A multivalent ligand containing about 16 sugar residues appears to be the minimal antigenic size required for triggering conformational changes attributed to the Fc part, similar to those seen in the interaction with the whole polysaccharide antigen."}
{"_id": "52", "description": "Evidence of the involvement of a 50S ribosomal protein in several active sites.. The functional role of the Bacillus stearothermophilus 50S ribosomal protein B-L3 (probably homologous to the Escherichia coli protein L2) was examined by chemical modification. The complex [B-L3-23S RNA] was photooxidized in the presence of rose bengal and the modified protein incorporated by reconstitution into 50S ribosomal subunits containing all other unmodified components. Particles containing photooxidized B-L3 are defective in several functional assays, including (1) poly(U)-directed poly(Phe) synthesis, (2) peptidyltransferase activity, (3) ability to associate with a [30S-poly(U)-Phe-tRNA] complex, and (4) binding of elongation factor G and GTP. The rates of loss of the partial functional activities during photooxidation of B-L3 indicate that at least two independent inactivating events are occurring, a faster one, involving oxidation of one or more histidine residues, affecting peptidyltransferase and subunit association activities and a slower one affecting EF-G binding. Therefore the protein B-L3 has one or more histidine residues which are essential for peptidyltransferase and subunit association, and another residue which is essential for EF-G-GTP binding. B-L3 may be the ribosomal peptidyltransferase protein, or a part of the active site, and may contribute functional groups to the other active sites as well."}

The localization of the previously postulated interface recognition site (IRS) in porcine pancreatic phospholipase A2, required for a specific interaction between the enzyme and organized lipid-water interfaces, was investigated by ultraviolet difference spectroscopy, by measurements of the intrinsic fluorescence of the unique Trp residue, and by protection experiments against specific tryptic hydrolysis. Using the enzymically nondegradable substrate analogues: CnH(2n+1)(0-)OOCH2CH2N+(CH3)3-(H,OH), it is shown that the rather hydrophobic N-terminal sequence of the enzyme, viz., Ala-Leu-Trp-Gln-Phe-Arg, is directly involved in the interaction with the lipid-water interface. Besides hydrophobic probably also polar interactions contribute to the binding process. At neutral or acidic pH the presence of a salt bridge between the N-terminal alpha-NH3+ group and a negatively charged side chain stablizes the interface recognition site and allows the enzyme to penetrate micellar surfaces, even in the absence of metal ion. At alkaline pH, interaction of the enzyme with micellar interfaces requires the presence of Ca2+ (Ba2+) ions."}
{"_id": "54", "description": "Phospholipase A2 as a probe of phospholipid distribution in erythrocyte membranes. Factors influencing the apparent specificity of the reaction.. The action of snake venom phospholipases A2 in intact human erythrocytes was investigated in detail. The basis phospholipase from Agkistrodon halys blomhifii was found to induce both hydrolysis of membrane phospholipids and total cell hemolysis under certain experimental conditions. The hydrolytic action of the basic enzyme was found to consist of two sequential events: (a) hydrolysis of 70% of the total cell ph osphatidylcholine without any evident hemolysis; and (b) complete hydrolysis of the remaining phosphatidylcholine, followed closely by extensive phosphatidylethanolamine hydrolysis and finally with onset of hemolysis, attack on the phosphatidylserine. At pH 7.4 and 10 mM Ca2+ only stage (a) occurred. However, a slight elevation of the pH of incubation to pH 8.0 and/or inclusion of 40 mM Ca2+ in the reaction mixture caused both events (a) and (b) to occur. The addition of glucose limited the action of the enzyme to stage (a) under any reaction conditions. An investigation showed that enzymically induced hemolysis occurred under conditions where the intracellular ATP levels were lowered. Data are presented which suggest that stage (b) is mediated by in influx of Ca2+ into the cell when the levels of ATP are low. Interestingly the phosphllipase from Naja naja venom (Pakistan) yielded results similar to those observed with the basic enzyme from Agkistrodon venom. However, the enzyme from Crotalus adamanteus and the acidic enzyme also present in the Agkistrodon venom produced only slight hydrolysis or hemolysis under any of the conditions studied. Other species of erythrocytes, e.g., guinea pig, monkey, pig, and rat, were tested but only those from guinea pig behaved similarly to the human cells. Pig, monkey, and rat erythrocytes underwent very limited hydrolysis and hemolysis. It is evident that the use of these phospholipases to probe the localization of phospholipds in erythrocyte membranes must be approached with caution. Certain facets of this problem are discussed."}
{"_id": "55", "description": "Subunit interactions in yeast glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase.. The spontaneous inactivation of yeast glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase was found to fit a simple two-state model at pH 8.5 and 25 degrees. The first step is a relatively rapid dissociation of the tetramer to dimers with the equilibrium largely in favor of the tetramer. In the absence of NAD+ the dimer inactivates irreversibly. The apoenzyme is quite stable with a half-life for complete activity loss proportional to the square root of the enzyme concentration. Perturbances of the protein structure (by pH, ionic strength, and specific salts), which have no effect on the tetrameric state of the molecule, result in an alteration of the cooperativity of NAD+ binding, the reactivity of the active-site sulfhydryl group, and the catalytic activity of the enzyme. Covalent modification of two of the four active-site sulfhydryl groups has profound effects on the enzymic activity which are mediated by changes in the subunit interactions. Sedimentation analysis and hybridization studies indicate that the interaction between subunits remains strong after covalent modification. Under normal physiological and equilibrium dialysis conditions the protein is a tetramer. Equilibrium dialysis studies of NAD+ binding to the enzyme at pH 8.5 and 25 degrees reveal a mixed cooperativity pattern. A model consistent with these observations and the observed half-of-the-sites reactivity is that of ligand induced sequential conformational changes which are transferred across strongly interacting subunit domains. Methods for distinguishing negatively cooperative binding patterns from mixtures of denatured enzyme and multiple species are discussed."}
{"_id": "56", "description": "Kinetic light scattering studies on the dissociation of hemoglobin from Lumbricus terrestris.. The kinetics of the pH-induced dissociation of the 3 X 10(6) mol wt hemoglobin from Lumbricus terrestris (the earthworm) have been studied in a light-scattering stopped-flow apparatus. The ligand dependent dissociation data were fit well by a simple sequential model. The data for CO and oxyhemoglobin are consistent with Hb12 leads to 2Hb6 leads to 12Hb. Methemoglobin at pH 7 appears to be hexameric and the dissociation is consistent with the model: Hb6 leads to 6Hb. In a sequential decay scheme for which light-scattering changes are monitored, the relative amounts of rapid and slow phase are determined by the rate constants as well as the molecular weights of intermediate species. Assignment of the hexameric intermediate is supported by an investigation of the sensitivity of the theoretical kinetic curves to the molecular weights of the intermediates. This assignment is further supported by the following: (1) the same model will fit the data for oxy- and CO-hemoglobin at all three temperatures (a 24-29-fold variation in rate constants), (2) evidence from electron microscopy shows hexameric forms, and (3) methemoglobin is apparently stable as a hexamer at pH 7. When CO replaces O2 as the ligand, the dissociation rate increases by a factor of four. The met is about 20 times faster than the initial oxyhemoglobin dissociation rate, but perhaps more relevant for comparing dissociation of the hexamer, the met rate was respectively 100 times and 500 times faster than that for the assumed hexameric forms of CO- and oxy-hemoglobin. The activation energies for the dodecamer to hexamer dissociation and for the dissociation of the hexamer to smaller forms were about 30 kcal/mol for oxy-, CO-, and methemoglobin."}

The reduction of metmyoglobin by the iron(II) complex of trans-1,2-diaminocyclohexane-N,N,N'N'-tetraacetate (FeCDTA2-) has been investigated. The equilibrium constant, measured spectrophotometrically, is 0.21 with a resulting reduction potential of 0.050 V for Mb0. The rate constant for the reduction is 28 M-1 sec-1 with a deltaH ++ of 13 kcal M-1 and deltaS ++ of -11 eu. Both CN- and OH- inhibit the reduction because of the relatively low reactivity of cyanometmyoglobin (Mb+CN-) and ionized metmyglobin (Mb+OH-). The rate constant for the reduction of Mb+CN- by FeCDTA2- is 4.0 X 10(-2) M-1 sec-1 and that for reduction of Mb+OH- is 4.8 M-1 sec-1. The nitric oxide complex of metmyoglobin is reduced with a rate constant of 10 M-1 sec-1. The kinetics of oxidation of oxymyoglobin by FeCDTA- were studied. The data are consistent with a mechanism where oxidation takes place entirely through the deoxy form. A rate constant of 1.45 X 10(2) M-1 sec-1 was calculated for the oxidation of deoxymyoglobin by FeCDTA-, in equilibrium constant and rate constant for reduction. The above data are discussed in terms of a simple outer-sphere reduction reaction."}
{"_id": "58", "description": "Constitution and properties of axonal membranes of crustacean nerves.. The purification of axonal membranes of crustaceans was followed by measuring enrichment in [3H]tetrodotoxin binding capacity and in Na+, K+-ATPase activity. A characteristic of these membranes is their high content of lipids and their low content of protein as compared to other types of plasmatic membranes. The axonal membrane contains myosin-like, actin-like, tropomyosin-like, and tubulin-like proteins. It also contains Na+, K+-ATPase and acetylcholinesterase. The molecular weights of these two enzymes after solubilization are 280,000 and 270,000, respectively. The molecular weights of the catalytic subunits are 96,000 for ATPase and 71,000 for acetylcholinesterase. We confirmed the presence of a nicotine binding component in the axonal membrane of the lobster but we have been unable to find [3H]nicotine binding to crab axonal membranes. The binding to axonal membranes og of the sodium channel, has been studied in detail. The dissociation constant for the binding of [3H]tetrodotoxin to the axonal membrane receptor is 2.9 nM at pH 7.4. The concentration of the tetrodotoxin receptor in crustacean membranes is about 10 pmol/mg of membrane protein, 7 times less than the acetylcholinesterase, 30 times less than the Na+, K+-ATPase, and 30 times less than the nicotine binding component in the lobster membrane. A reasonable estimate indicates that approximately only one peptide chain in 1000 constitutes the tetrodotoxin binding part of the sodium channel in the axonal membrane. Veratridine, which acts selectively on the resting sodium permeability, binds to the phospholipid part of the axonal membrane. [3H]Veratridine binding to membranes parallels the electrophysiological effect. Veratridine and tetrodotoxin have different receptor sites. Although tetrodotoxin can repolarize the excitable membrane of a giant axon depolarized by veratridine, veratridine does not affect the binding of [3H]tetrodotoxin to purified axonal membranes. Similarly, tetrodotoxin does not affect the binding of [3H]veratridine to axonal membranes. Scorpion neurotoxin I, a presynaptic toxin which affects both the Na+ and the K+ channels, does not interfere with the binding of [3H]tetrodotoxin or [3H]veratridine to axonal membranes. Tetrodotoxin, veratridine, and scorpion neurotoxin I, which have in common the perturbation of the normal functioning of the sodium channel, act upon three different types of receptor sites."}

A new procedure is described for selecting nitrogenase-derepressed mutants based on the method of Brenchley et al. (Brenchley, J.E., Prival, M.J. and Magasanik, B. (1973) J. Biol. Chem. 248, 6122-6128) for isolating histidase-constitutive mutants of a non-N2-fixing bacterium. 2. Nitrogenase levels of the new mutants in the presence of NH4+ were as high as 100% of the nitrogenase activity detected in the absence of NH4+. 3. Biochemical characterization of these nitrogen fixation (nif) derepressed mutants reveals that they fall into three classes. Three mutants (strains SK-24, 28 and 29), requiring glutamate for growth, synthesize nitrogenase and glutamine synthetase constitutively (in the presence of NH4+). A second class of mutants (strains SK-27 and 37) requiring glutamine for growth produces derepressed levels of nitrogenase activity and synthesized catalytically inactive glutamine synthetase protein, as determined immunologically. A third class of glutamine-requiring, nitrogenase-derepressed mutants (strain SK-25 and 26) synthesizes neither a catalytically active glutamine synthetase enzyme nor an immunologically cross-reactive glutamine synthetase protein. 4. F-prime complementation analysis reveals that the mutant strains SK-25, 26, 27, 37 map in a segment of the Klebsiella chromosome corresponding to the region coding for glutamine synthetase. Since the mutant strains SK-27 and SK-37 produce inactive glutamine synthetase protein, it is concluded that these mutations map within the glutamine synthetase structural gene."}

S -1 and as the pH increases above 6.7 the rate constant steadily decreases. The dependence on pH is the same for tuna heart and horse heart cytochrome c. No reaction could be demonstrated between O2- and the form of cytochrome c which exists above pH approximately 9.2. The dependence of the rate constant on pH can be explained if cytochrome c has pKs of 7.45 and 9.2, and O2- reacts with the form present below pH 7.45 with k = 1.4-10(6) M-1 - S-1, the form above pH 7.45 with k = 3.0- 10(5) M-1 - S-1, and the form present above pH 9.2 with k = 0. 3.

It is suggested that O2- may reduce cytochrome c through a track composed of aromatic amino acids, and that little protein rearrangement is required for the formation of the activated complex. 4. No reduction of ferricytochrome c by HO2 radicals could be demonstrated at pH 1.2-6.2 but at pH 5.3, HO2 radicals oxidize ferrocytochrome c with a rate constant of about 5-10(5)-5-10(6) M-1 - S-1."}

The semiquinone to chlorophyll ratio was between 1/20 and 1/70 in various preparations.

Upon darkening absorbance and ESR changes decayed together in a cyclic or back reaction which was stimulated by 3-(3,4 dichlorophenyl)-1,1-dimethylurea. The donor could be oxidized by ferricyanide in the dark. Illumination in the presence of ferricyanide induced absorbance and ESR changes, rapidly reversed upon darkening, which may be ascribed to the oxidation of a chlorophyll a dimer, possibly the primary electron donor of photosystem II.

The enzymes released all the alpha-linked mannose residues from each oligosaccharide and were most effective on the smallest substrate. Enzyme A in each case was less active on the oligosaccharides than alpha-mannosidase B2, even though the apparent Km value for the substrates was the same with each enzyme. The human acidic alpha-mannosidases were also found to be more active on substrates isolated from human rather than bovine mannosidosis urine. Human alpha-mannosidase C, which has a neutral pH optimum when assayed with a synthetic substrate, did not hydrolyse any of the oligosaccharides at neutral pH, but was found to be active at an acidic pH."}

The characterization and localization of a Ca(2+)-ATPase (ATP phosphohydrolase, EC 3.6.1.3) in the tooth germ of the porcine fetus are reported. This enzyme, a microsome fraction, is preferentially activated by Ca(2+). In the presence of 0.5 mM ATP, maximal enzyme activity is obtained at 0.5--1.0 mM CaCl2. The maximal rate of ATP hydrolysis is approx. 20 mumol per h per mg of protein as the enzyme preparation is used here. At optimal Ca(2+) concentration, the Mg(2+) has an inhibitory effect. The enzyme does not require Na+ or/and K+ for activation by Ca(2+). Other nucleotide triphosphates may serve as the substrate, but V for ATP is the highest. The Km for ATP is 8.85 - 10(-5) M. The optimal pH for Ca(2+) activation of the enzyme lies around 9.2. Well known inhibitors of (Na+ + K+)-ATPase, mitochondria ATPase and Ca(2+)-ATPase in the erthrocyte do not inhibit the enzyme. In the subcellular order the enzyme may be assumed to be localized in the smooth endoplasmic reticulum fraction containing cell and Golgi body membrane fragments and in the tissue order in the enamel organ containing an ameloblast layer, stratum intermedium and stellate reticulum."}

Purified skeletal muscle myosin (EC 3.6.1.3) has been covalently bound to Sepharose 4B by the cyanogen bromide procedure. The resulting complex, Sepharose-Myosin, possesses adenosine triphosphatase activity and is relatively stable for long periods of time. Under optimal binding conditions, approximately 33% of the specific ATPase activity of the bound myosin is retained. Polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of polypeptides released from denatured Sepharose-Myosin indicates that 85% of the myosin is attached to the agarose beads through the heavy chains and the remainder through the light chains, in agreement with predictions of binding and release based upon either the lysine contents or molecular weights of themyosin subunits. The adenosine triphosphatase of the immobilized myosin has been investigated under conditions of varying pH, ionic strength, and cation concentration. The ATPase profiles of immobilized myosin are quite similar to those for free myosin, however subtle differences are found. The Sepharose-Myosin ATPase is not as sensitive as myosin to alterations in salt concentration and the apparent KM is approximately two-fold higher than that of myosin. These differences are probably due to chemical modification in the region of the attachment site(s) to the agarose beads and hydration and diffusion limitations imposed by the polymeric agarose matrix."}

The pH dependencies of the apparent Michaelis constant for oxidized glutathione and the apparent turnover number of yeast glutathione reductase (EC 1.6.4.2) have been determined at a fixed concentration of 0.1 mM NADPH in the range pH 4.5--8.0. Between pH 5.5 and 7.6, both of these parameters are relatively constant. The principal effect of low pH on the kinetics of the enzyme-catalyzed reaction is the observation of a pH-dependent substrate inhibition by oxidized glutathione at pH less than or equal 7, which is shown to correlate with the binding of oxidized glutathione to the oxidized form of the enzyme. 2. The catalytic activity of yeast glutathione reductase at pH 5.5 is affected by the sodium acetate buffer concentration. The stability of the oxidized and reduced forms of the enzyme at pH 5.5 and 25 degrees C in the absence of bovine serum albumin was studied as a function of sodium acetate concentration. The results show that activation of the catalytic activity of the enzyme at low sodium acetate concentration correlates with an effect of sodium acetate on a reduced form of the enzyme. In contrast, inhibition of the catalytic activity of the enzyme at high sodium acetate concentration correlates with an effect of sodium acetate on the oxidized form of the enzyme."}

Based on incorporation of radioactively labeled N-ethylmaleimide, the readily reactive thiol groups of isolated myosin (EC 3.6.1.3) from fast, slow and cardiac muscles could be classified into 3 types. All 3 myosins contain 2 thiol-1, 2 thiol-2 and a variable number of thiol-3 groups per molecule. Both thiol-1 and thiol-2 groups which are essential for functioning of the K+-stimulated ATPase, are located in the heavy chains in all 3 myosin types. 2. The variation in the incorporation pattern of N-ethylmaleimide over the 3 thiol group classes under steady-state conditions of Mg(2+) - ATP hydrolysis allowed different conformations of some reaction intermediates to be characterized. In all 3 types of myosin the hydrolytic cycle of Mg(2+) - ATP was found to be controlled by the same step at 25 degrees C. In all three cases, this rate-limiting step is changed in the same way by lowereing temperature. 3. Using the chemically determined molecular weights for myosin light chains, their stoichiometry was found on the basis of sodium dodecyl sulfate electrophoresis to be 1.2 : 2.1 : 0.8 for light chain-1: light chain-2:light chain-3 per molecule of fast myosin, 2.0 : 1.9 for light chain-1:light chain-2 per molecule of slow myosin and 1.9 : 1.9 for light chain-1:light chain-2 per molecule of cardiac myosin. This qualitative difference in light subunit composition between the fast and the two types of slow myosin is not reflected in the small variations of the characteristics exhibited by the isolated myosins, but rather seems to be connected with their respective myofibrillar ATPase activities."}
{"_id": "76", "description": "Multiple forms of casein kinase from rabbit erythrocytes.. Two rabbit erythrocyte casein kinases, GTP:casein kinase I and GTP:casein kinase II, have been purified 29 000- and 47 000-fold, respectively. Studies employing sucrose density gradient centrifugation indicate that kinase I has a molecular weight of about 9.5 - 10(5) (25 S) and kinase II about 1.4 - 10(6) (32 S). These enzymes can utilize either ATP or GTP as the phosphoryl donor. Among various protein substrates examined, these kinases catalyze the phosphorylation of casein greater than 50% dephosphorylated phosvitin congruent to 50% dephosphorylated casein greater than phosvitin. Histones, protamine and bovine serum albumin are poor phosphoryl acceptors. Kinetic data indicate that both enzymes are inhibited by high casein substrate concentrations which may be partially relieved by NaCl. Both phosphotransferases require Mg(2+) for activity and are optimally active at pH 9.0. The enzymes have apparent Km values of 2.5 - 10(-5) M for GTP, 2 - 10(-5) M for ATP, and 0.4--0.6 mg/ml for casein. The incorporation of the terminal phosphate of GTP into casein as catalyzed by these enzymes is inhibited to varying degrees by ATP, ITP, ADP, and GDP but not by UTP, CTP, GMP, adenosine 3':5'-cyclic monophosphate, and guanosine 3':5'-cyclic monophosphate. In addition, NaF and 2,3-diphosphoglyceric acid are also found to inhibit the activity of both kinases. The effect of 2,3-diphosphoglycerate is interesting and suggests that this metabolite may regulate the activity of the casein kinases in the red blood cells."}

The phosphorylated form of liver glycogen phosphorylase (alpha-1,4-glucan : orthophosphate alpha-glucosyl-transferase, EC 2.4.1.1) (phosphorylase a) is active and easily measured while the dephosphorylated form (phosphorylase b), in contrast to the muscle enzyme, has been reported to be essentially inactive even in the presence of AMP. We have purified both forms of phosphorylase from rat liver and studied the characteristics of each. Phosphorylase b activity can be measured with our assay conditions. The phosphorylase b we obtained was stimulated by high concentrations of sulfate, and was a substrate for muscle phosphorylase kinase whereas phosphorylase a was inhibited by sulfate, and was a substrate for liver phosphorylase phosphatase. Substrate binding to phosphorylase b was poor (KM glycogen = 2.5 mM, glucose-1-P = 250 mM) compared to phosphorylase a (KM glycogen = 1.8 mM, KM glucose-1-P = 0.7 mM). Liver phosphorylase b was active in the absence of AMP. However, AMP lowered the KM for glucose-1-P to 80 mM for purified phosphorylase b and to 60 mM for the enzyme in crude extract (Ka = 0.5 mM). Using appropriate substrate, buffer and AMP concentrations, assay conditions have been developed which allow determination of phosphorylase a and 90% of the phosphorylase b activity in liver extracts. Interconversion of the two forms can be demonstrated in vivo (under acute stimulation) and in vitro with little change in total activity. A decrease in total phosphorylase activity has been observed after prolonged starvation and in diabetes."}

A purification procedure for creatine kinase (EC 2.7.3.2) from muscle of the monke35--170 muequiv H+/mg protein per min at 30 degrees C and a yield of approx. 0.5 g/kg muscle. Assuming equilibrium kinetics, synergistic binding of substrates at one catalytic site is found for both the forward and back reactions. Kinetic constants for the binding of each substrate to the free enzyme and the enzyme-second substrate complex are determined and are compared with those for the enzyme from other species. Inhibition by small anions is determined in the presence of different combinations of substrates and products. SO4(2-) inhibits by simple competitive inhibition and probably binds at the site of the transferrable phosphoryl group. Inhibition by NO3-, NO2-, SCN- and Cl- is more complex and these ions are suggested to mimic the transferrable phosphoryl group in a planar transition-state complex. These anions stabilize the dead-end complex, enzyme-creatine-MgADP, which lacks the transferable phosphoryl group. The effects of these anions on the dissociation constants of the enzyme-substrate complexes is reported and is in accord with the above hypothesis. The dead-end complex in the absence of anion does not protect the essential thiol group against inhibition by iodoacetamide. Addition of NO3- or Cl- to the dead-end complex or a substrate equilibrium mixture without anion confers protection. The essential thiol group is inhibited by iodoacetamide at a rate which is essentially independent of pH over the normal stability range of the enzyme. Contrary to our previous report this pH independence is not altered by the presence of dead-end complex, creatine plus MgADP, in the presence or absence of anion or in the presence of a substrate equilibrium mixture. It is  inferred that the 'essential' thiol group of the monkey enzyme has essentially the same properties as that of the rabbit enzyme. In consequence, the inferences made about the role of this group based on our previous work on the monkey enzyme are no longer valid. The present findings are compatible with the essential thiol group playing a conformational role in the catalytic process."}

A technique has been developed to separate and measure kallikrein in a heterogeneous population of rat renal cortical cells in suspension. After rat kidneys were perfused in situ in anaesthetized rats, viable, counted cortical cell suspensions were obtained. Cells were suspended in a sucrose/Tris buffer containing 0.5% deoxycholate, homogenized, centrifuged, dialyzed, and gel filtered on Sephadex G-25. Column chromatography on DEAE-cellulose resulted in a single peak of esterase activity between 0.20 to 0.25 M NaCl/sodium phosphate buffer. Subsequent elution yielded an alkaline esterase which was identical to kallikrein isolated from rat urine, insofar as pH optimum, effects of inhibitors, bioassay activity and immunological properties were concerned. Calculated yields were about 70% of the total esterase activity present in the parent cell homogenates. Recoveries of a purified rat urinary kallikrein added to the cell homogenates, the DEAE-cellulose columns, or the eluates from the columns ranged from 83-108% (mean 96%). Using this technique, it was found that the amount of kallikrein activity present in non-incubated renal cortical cells ranged from 0.6-10(-2) to 4.6 - 10(-2) alpha-N-tosyl-L-arginine methyl ester (Tos-Arg-OMe) esterase units per 10(8) cells.

{"_id": "80", "description": "The binding of organic phosphates to human methaemoglobin A. Perturbation of the polymerization of proteins by effectors.. Theory is presented relating to the binding of an effector to two states of a protein acceptor coexisting in equilibrium. The problem is treated in terms of the four possible cases which specify relations between numbers of binding sites and intrinsic binding constants relevant to the acceptor states. It is shown that a distinction between these cases may be possible on the basis of the form of a plot of unbound effector concentration versus the constituent equilibrium coefficient which may be calculated from the sedimentation coefficient of the protein constituent. Particularly noteworthy in this respect is the finding that a turning point may exist in this plot for defined conditions with systems in which binding sites are not conserved (and binding affinities are altered) on polymer formation. The latter type of system is exemplified by studies on methaemoglobin A in 0.25 M sodium acetate, pH 5.4. In the absence of added organic phosphate effectors, a dimer-tetramer equilibrium operates governed by an association constant of 4.15 +/- 0.06 X 10(3) 1/mol, determined from sedimentation equilibrium results. Correlation of sedimentation velocity and equilibrium results shows that addition of adenosine 5'-triphosphate (ATP) results in its binding to one site on each of the dimeric (alpha beta) and tetrameric (alpha beta)2 species with intrinsic binding constants 1.03-10(3)-1.20-10(3) and 1.1-10(4)-2.1-10(4) 1/mol, respectively.

Human hemoglobin was spin labeled with 4-isothiocanato-2,2,6,6-tetramethyl-piperdinooxyl, which is known to bind specifically to the N-terminal alpha-amino groups of proteins and slightly to the reactive sulfhydryl groups. Electron spin resonance (ESR) analysis indicated a partially resolved five-line spectrum, suggesting that the label was attached to at least two different binding sites. Using specific blocking reagents prior to spin labeling, the two binding sites were attributed to the sulfhydryl group of beta-93 (immobile) and the alpha-amino group of the N-terminal valines (mobile). The relative motion of the spin at one set of binding sites was restricted regardless of the state of ligation and pH, while the motion at the other site showed dependence on those parameters, e.g. the spin-labeled N-terminal ends of deoxyhemoglobin have restricted motion at all pH ranges studied, while those of oxyhemoglobin are relatively free to move at the basic pH range, but become more restricted in the acidic pH range."}

The circular dichroism at 600 nm was essentially lost while a weak negative band appeared at approx. 380 nm and a positive band at 310 nm. 3. The EPR spectrum was also modified on changing from the native to the low pH form: A parallel increased from approximately 130 to approximately 150 G, g parallel remained unchanged at approximately 2.27, and gm decreased from approximately 2.09 to approximately 2.08. The apparent linewidth remained essentially constant. 4. High resolution (220 MHz) PMR spectra of holo- and apoproteins revealed that the metals influence the three-dimensional structure of the protein. 5.

The contractile proteins from arterial smooth muscle are highly soluble, and can be extracted at I = 0.05. However, they can be precipitated by a prolonged dialysis at pH 6 to give an actomyosin with a high, although variable, actin:myosin ratio. The sedimentation behavior of this actomyosin at high ionic strength was examined as a function of pH, protein concentration and composition by preparative ultracentrifugation. Comparisons with synthetic skeletal muscle actomyosins of similar composition demonstrated significant differences in the behaviors of these two systems. It was found that much smooth muscle actomyosin is not dissociated by normally relaxing conditions, and that it sediments at a slower rate than F-actin. The solubility of the supernatant protein (a myosin-enriched actomyosin) in 0.2 M K Cl (pH 7) depended on the pH during centrifugation. A lower solubility was associated only with a higher actin concentration in the supernatant, suggesting a dependence on actin repolymerization. Pure myosin was selectively precipitated from the supernatant by polyethylene glycol-6000, but only when the protein was soluble at low ionic strength. The solubility of purified myosin was similar to that of myosin from striated muscles. A relationship between the presence of depolymerized actin and the high solubility of smooth muscle contractile proteins is suggested."}

A minimum molecular weight of 24000 +/- 1500 per heme group was determined from the iron and heme contents, 0.22 +/- 0.01 and 2.73 +/- 0.14 weight %, respectively. The subunit composition of the erythrocruorin was investigated using gel filtration in sodium dodecyl sulfate and polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in sodium dodecyl sulfate at neutral pH. Haemopis erythrocruorin dissociated in the presence of sodium dodecyl sulfate into four subunits (1 through 4) possessing molecular weights of about 27000, 23000, 21000 and 13500, respectively. When the erythrocruorin was reduced with mercaptoethanol prior to sodium dodecyl sulfate electrophoresis, three subunits  were observed, possessing molecular weights of about 13000 (I), 16500 (II) and 28000 (III). Sodium dodecyl sulfate electrophoresis of the isolated subunits 1 through 4 showed that subunit I was provided by subunits 1 and 4, subunit II was provided by subunit 1 and subunit III was provided by both subunit 2 and subunit 3. Haemopis erythrocruorin thus appeared to consist of at least five different polypeptide chains. It is likely that not all of the constituent polypeptide chains were associated each with a heme group.

A comparison of the activities of these two hybrids with the activities of the succinyl, nitrotyrosyl and aminotyrosyl derivatives has shown that either the subunits of alkaline phosphatase function independently or if the subunits turnover alternately in a reciprocating mechanism, then the intrinsic activity of each subunit must be strongly dependent on its partner subunit."}

The (Na+ +K+)-activated, Mg2+-dependent ATPase from rabbit kidney outer medulla was prepared in a partially inactivated, soluble form depleted of endogenous phospholipids, using deoxycholate. This preparation was reactivated 10 to 50-fold by sonicated liposomes of phosphatidylserine, but not by non-sonicated phosphatidylserine liposomes or sonicated phosphatidylcholine liposomes. The reconstituted enzyme resembled native membrane preparations of (Na+ +K+)-ATPase in its pH optimum being around 7.0, showing optimal activity at Mg2+:ATP mol ratios of approximately 1 and a Km value for ATP of 0.4 mM. Arrhenius plots of this reactivated activity at a constant pH of 7.0 and an Mg2+: ATP mol ratio of 1:1 showed a discontinuity (sharp change of slope) at 17 degrees C, with activation energy (Ea) values of 13-15 kcal/mol above this temperature and 30-35 kcal below it. A further discontinuity was also found at 8.0 degrees C and the Ea below this was very high (greater than 100 kcal/mol). Increased Mg2+ concentrations at Mg2+:ATP ratios in excess of 1:1 inhibited the (Na+ +K+)-ATPase activity and also abolished the discontinuities in the Arrhenius plots. The addition of cholesterol to phosphatidylserine at a 1:1 mol ratio partially inhibited (Na+ +K+)-ATPase reactivation. Arrhenius plots under these conditions showed a single discontinuity at 20 degrees C and Ea values of 22 and 68 kcal/mol above and below this temperature respectively. The ouabain-insensitive Mg2+-ATPase normally showed a linear Arrhenius plot with an Ea of 8 kcal/mol. The cholesterol-phosphatidylserine mixed liposomes stimulated the Mg2+-ATPase activity, which now also showed a discontinuity at 20 degrees C with, however, an increased value of 14 kcal/mol above this temperature and 6 kcal/mol below. Kinetic studies showed that cholesterol had no significant effect on the Km values for ATP. Since both cholesterol and Mg2+ are known to alter the effects of temperature on the fluidity of phospholipids, the above results are discussed in this context."}

A preparation of ATPase from the membranes of Micrococcus lysodeikticus, solubilized and more than 95% pure, showed two main bands in analytical polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. They did not correspond to isoenzymes because one band could be converted into the other by exposure to a mildly alkaline pH value. The conversion was paralleled by changes in molecular weight, circular dichroism and catalytic properties. Denaturation by pH at 25 degrees C was followed by means of circular dichroism, ultracentrifugation and polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. A large conformational transition took place in the acid range with midpoints at about pH = 3.6 (I = 10(-4) M), 4.3 (I = 0.03 M) and 5.3 (I = 0.1 M). The transition was irreversible. Strong aggregation of the protein occurred in this range of pH. The final product was largely random coil, but even at pH 1.5 dissociation into individual subunits was not complete. However, partial dissociation took place at pH 5 (I = 0.028 M). At this pH value the enzyme was inactive, but 20-30% of the activity could be recovered when the pH was returned to 7.5. In the alkaline region the midpoint of the transition occurred near pH = 11 (I = 0.028 M). The pK of most of the tyrosine residues of the protein was about 10.9. The unfolding was irreversible and the protein was soon converted into peptide species with molecular weights lower than those determined for the subunits by gel electrophoresis in the presence of sodium dodecyl sulphate.

Considerable changes of fluorescence and CD spectra were observed at pH 8 and 10, where there is ionization of two more recently titrated tyrosin residues. It is assumed that these two tyrosine residues are in binding region and quench the fluorescence of DMH between pH 4 to 8. Quenching disappears if these residues are ionized (pH greater than 8) or if the protein undergoes the N -F transition (pH less than 4)."}

Results are presented of measuring fibrinogen fluorescence parameters in temperature range of 20-80 degrees C at different pH of the solution. It was found that the temperature increase from 20 to 40 degrees C for solutions with pH of 4,5-9,3 were not accompanied by the conformational changes of fibrinogen macromolecules. In the temperature range of 40-50 degrees C for neutral solutions conformational reconstruction of fibrinogen of undenatured character took place. Temperature increase above 50-55 degrees C brings about significant structural changes of fibrinogen molecule which are of denaturation nature."}

When hypoxic gaseous mixture was given for respiration the developing hypocapnia disturbed the discharge rhythmic activity of the respiratory neurons, the respiration acquiring a pathological character of the Cheyne--Stokes type. After addition to the hypoxic gaseous mixture of 2% CO2 the gaseous composition of the arterial blood approached the initial values; this addition prevented the development of hypercapnia and disturbances of rhythmic discharge activity of the respiratory neurons. Addition of 5% CO2 to the hypoxic gaseous mixture produced a negative effect: at first it intensified and then depressed the pulse activity of the respiratory neurons, caused metabolic and respiratory acidosis, and promoted asphyxia."}

Drinking water supplies of 161 rural communities, in Georgetown County, South Carolina, were randomly selected for sample collection. The analysis showed that most of the waters were slightly acidic. Low, but acceptable concentrations of chloride, copper, fluoride, sodium, cadmium, nitrate and phosphate were found. A few water samples showed higher then recommended levels of arsenic, mercury, zinc and lead. Although only 2% of the samples exceeded the mandatory limit of 0.05 ppm for arsenic, 72% exceeded the recommended level of 0.01 ppm. The mandatory limit for manganese was exceeded in 37% of the waters while 88% exceeded the limit for iron. The high iron content was generally responsible for the high turbidity found in 45% of the samples. The well depth and the consumer income had some bearing on water quality. Statistical evidence suggested that septic tank seepage was partially responsible for nitrate, phosphate, iron and arsenic contamination of shallow water supplies. Lead concentrations appear to vary according to the plumbing used and the pH of the waters."}

This study has investigated the relationship between duodenogastric reflux, gastritis and certain symptoms 6-12 months after three operations for uncomplicated duodenal ulcer. The operations studied were proximal gastric vagotomy (PGV, 20 cases), truncal vagotomy and pyloroplasty (TV+P, 22 cases) and truncal vagotomy and antrectomy (TV+A, 21 cases). Duodenogastric reflux was assessed both by a radiological technique and by measuring the concentration of bilirubin in the gastric aspirate before and after operation. Incidence and severity of postoperative gastritis were determined by endoscopic biopsy. Symptoms were assessed by symptomatic score and Visick grading. There was a significant correlation between duodenal reflux and histological evidence of both severe superficial gastritis and glandular atrophy (P less than 0-01). There was also a close association between the degree of reflux and the presence of severe heartburn, epigastric pain and bile vomiting after operation. The amount of reflux did not differ before operation. There was significantly less reflux following PGV than after either TV+P (P less than 0-025) or TV+A (P less than 0-001).

A new haemoglobin with increased oxygen affinity, beta82 (EF6) lysine leads to threonine (Hb Rahere), was found during the investigation of a patient who was found to have a raised haemoglobin concentration after a routine blood count. The substitution affects one of the 2, 3-diphosphoglycerate binding sites, resulting in an increased affinity for oxygen, but both the haem-haem interaction and the alkaline Bohr effect are normal in the haemolysate. This variant had the same mobility as haemoglobin A on electrophoresis at alkaline pH but was detected by measuring the whole blood oxygen affinity; it could be separated from haemoglobin A, however, by electrophoresis in agar at acid pH. The raised haemoglobin concentration was mainly due to a reduction in plasma volume (a relative polycythaemia) and was associated with a persistently raised white blood count. This case emphasises the need to measure the oxygen affinity of haemoglobin in all patients with absolute or relative polycythaemia when some obvious cause is not evident."}

The actions of glycine, GABA, alpha-alanine, beta-alanine and taurine were studied by intracellular recordings from lumbar motoneurons of the isolated spinal cord of the frog. All amino acids tested produced a reduction in the amplitude of postsynaptic potentials, a blockade of the antidromic action potential and an increase of membrane conductance. Furthermore, membrane polarizations occurred, which were always in the same direction as the IPSP. All these effects indicate a postsynaptic inhibitory action of these amino acids. When the relative strength of different amino acids was compared, taurine had the strongest inhibitory potency, followed by beta-alanine, alpha-alanine, GABA and glycine. Topically applied strychnine and picrotoxin induced different changes of post-synaptic potentials, indicating that distinct inhibitory systems might be influenced by these two convulsants. Interactions with amino acids showed that picrotoxin seletively diminished the postsymaptic actions of GABA, while strychnine reduced the effects of taurine, glycine, alpha- and beta-alanine. But differences in the susceptibility of these amino acid actions to strychnine could be detected: the action of taurine was more sensitively blocked by strychnine compared with glycine, alpha- and beta-alanine. With regard to these results the importance of taurine and GABA as transmitters of postsynaptic inhibition on motoneurons in the spinal cord of the frog is discussed."}

Torpedo marmorata electric organs were stimulated electrically in vivo at 5 pulses/sec for 30 min by electrodes placed on the electric lobe. Synaptic vesicles were isolated from each source and the phospholipid compositions analysed and compared with vesicles  from unstimulated controls. (2) Lysophosphatidylcholine was the only lysophosphoglyceride demonstrable in the synaptic vesicles from either source and its low levels did not increase as a result of chemical or electircal stimulation. In each case there was a close similarity of the phospholipid distributions in the vesicles taken from control and stimulated samples. (3) Control experiments indicated extensive decreases in the acetylcholine content of the vesicles from the stimulated electric organ and smaller decreases in the acetylcholine content of the synaptic vesicles from stimulated crude synaptosomal fractions. These fractions were found to respire linearly in the presence of 10 mM glucose and the vesicle fractions were shown to have low levels of contaiminating membranes as judged by marker enzyme analyses. (4) Crude synaptosomal fractions from guinea-pig cerebral cortex were incubated in a Krebs-glucose medium with labelled fatty acids and [3H]glucose in the presence or absence of 50 mM KCl.

Different groups of rabbit corneas were placed in saline as controls or in varying concentrations of hydrocortisone (10(-10) M to 10(-4) M at pH 7.4) at 37 degrees C and 4 degrees C. Acid phosphatase released after six hours was measured biochemically. This enzyme was used as a marker enzyme reflecting lysosomal labilization. Results showed a significant stabilization of the lysosomal membrane at 4 degrees C as compared to 37 degrees C.

Mock cerebrospinal fluid (pH 5.37-8.38) or 2,4-dinitrophenol (DNP) (0.15-1.5 mg) was injected into the subarachnoid space of the ventral brain stem of exteriorized fetal sheep. Changes in pH on the ventral surface of the medulla did not stimulate respiratory efforts or induce significant cardiovascular changes. The respiratory response to DNP injections ranged from no response to prolonged rhythmic ventilation that was independent of the peripheral chemoreceptors or the control arterial pH and blood gas tensions. This inconsistency suggests an effector site somewhat removed from the immediate surface of the medulla. The heart rate and blood pressure were not affected. It is concluded that increased H+ concentration in the extracellular fluid of the fetal ventral medulla does not initiate respiration, and any respiratory response to metabolic inhibitors applied to this area therefore is not attributable to a secondary change in surface pH."}

Axenic, washed conidia of Fusarium solani f. sp. phaseoli, Aspergillus flavus, and Verticillium albo-atrum were placed on washed Difco purified agar discs along with an inorganic salt solution containing various levels of carbon and nitrogen substrates. These discs were exposed to volatiles from six soils (pH 5.1-8.6). Fusarium solani macroconidial germination was inhibited mostly by volatiles from soils of pH 5.1, 6.1, 7.0, and 7.5, but high levels of glucose and NH4Cl reversed this inhibition, raising germination to that of no-soil, no-carbon or nitrogen controls. Conidial germination of A. flavus was inhibited mainly by volatiles from high pH (7.0, 7.8, and 8.6) soils, and increased levels of glucose plus an amino acid mixture nullified this inhibition. Volatiles from soils of pH 5.1, 6.1, and 7.5 stimulated A. flavus conidial germination. Assays after the removal of CO2 from the air above soil of pH 5.1 demonstrated that volatiles inhibitory to A. flavus were produced by this soil. Assays indicated that a KOH-soluble compound was a fungistatic soil volatile to F. solani macroconidial germination. The nullification by carbon and nitrogen substrates of F. solani and A. flavus inhibition caused by soil volatiles parallels that for soil fungistasis. Conidial germination of V. albo-atrum was markedly stimulated by volatiles in all soils tested, and was not affected by removal of CO2. Inhibitory soil volatiles may increase the nutritional requirements for spore germination of certain fungi."}

Earlier work showed that Escherichia coli contains at least two enzymes which reduce nitrofurazone and other nitrofuran derivatives.

We now report that there are three separable nitrofuran reductases in this organism: reductase I (mol. wt. approximately 50 000, insensitive to O2), reductase IIa (mol. wt. approximately 120 000, inhibited by oxygen), reductase IIb (mol. wt. approximately 700 000, inhibited by O2). Unstable metabolites formed during the reduction of nitrofurazone by preparations containing reductases IIa and IIb produce breaks in DNA in vitro. In vivo experiments with nitrofurazone-resistant strains, which lack reductase II but contain reductases IIa and IIb, demonstrated that lethality, mutation, and DNA breakage are all greatly increased when cultures are incubated under anaerobic conditions, i.e., conditions such that reductase II is active. These results provide further evidence for the importance of reductive activation of nitrofurazone."}

The adenosinetriphosphatase (ATPase) (EC 3.6.1.3) activity in Azotobacter vinelandii concentrates in the membranous R3 fraction that is directly associated with Azotobacter electron transport function. Sonically disrupted Azotobacter cells were examined for distribution of ATPase activity and the highest specific activity (and activity units) was consistently found in the particulate R3 membranous fraction which sediments on ultracentrifugation at 144 000 X g for 2 h. When the sonication time interval was increased, the membrane-bound ATPase activity could neither be solubilized nor released into the supernatant fraction. Optimal ATPase activty occurred at pH 8.0; Mg2+ ion when added to the assay was stimulatory. Maximal activity always occurred when the Mg2+:ATP stoichiometry was 1:1 on a molar ratio at the 5 mM concentration level. Sodium and potassium ions had no stimulatory effect. The reaction kinetics were linear for the time intervals studied (0-60 min). The membrane-bound ATPase in the R3 fraction was stimulated 12-fold by treatment wiTH TRypsin, and fractionation studies showed that trypsin treatment did not solubilize ATPase activity off the membranous R3 electron transport fraction. The ATPase was not cold labile and the temperature during the preparation of the R3 fraction had no effect on activity; overnight refrigeration at 4 degrees C, however, resulted in a 25% loss of activity as compared with a 14% loss when the R3 fraction was stored overnight at 25 degrees C. A marked inactivation (although variable, usually about 60%) did occur by overnight freezing (-20 degrees C), and subsequent sonication failed to restore ATPase activity. This indicates that membrane reaggregation (by freezing) was not responsible for ATPase inactivation. The addition of azide, ouabain, 2,4-dinitrophenol, or oligomycin to the assay system resulted in neither inhibition nor stimulation of the ATPase activity. The property of trypsin activation and that ATPase activity is highest in the R3 electron transport fraction suggests that its probable functional role is in coupling of electron transport to oxidative phosphorylation."}

Within 2 km of a zinc (Zn) smelter in Palmerton, Pennsylvania, near the Lehigh Water Gap, up to 13.5% Zn by weight has been measured in the O2 horizon of the soil, and up to 8% Zn in the A1 horizon. The total numbers of bacteria, actinomycetes, and fungi (measured by dilution plate counts) were greatly reduced in the most severely Zn-contaminated soils compared with control soils. The reduction of microbial populations may be a partial cause of the decreased rate of litter decomposition at Lehigh Gap. Growth of most bacteria from control sites was reduced by 100 to 200 muM Zn, most actinomycetes by 100 muM Zn, and most fungi by 100 to 1000 muM Zn in thin-Pablum extract agar (TPab). All the tested actinomycetes and non-spore-forming bacteria isolated from Zn-contaminated Lehigh Gap soils were Zn-tolerant, growing normally in media containing 600-2000 muM Zn. Most fungi, regardless of source, were capable of at least 50% of normal growth at 700 muM Zn. Zinc-tolerant bacteria, actinomycetes, and fungi were readily isolated from low-Zn soils, suggesting that selection for Zn tolerance may proceed rapidly. Acidophilic Mortierella species have been selectively eliminated near the smelter, apparently because of elevated soil pH.

Rapid decreases occurred in the activities of the first six enzymes, reaching minimal values at between 4 and 8 weeks. Activities then increased in all cases to control or nearly control levels. This rate of increase was least for cytochrome P-450. At 4 weeks azoreductase activity with the chemotherapeutic agent CB10-252 (I) as substrate was significantly higher than in control rats. Early increases occurred in the activities of beta-glucuronidase and arylsulphatase A and the activity of the latter never dropped below the control level.

{"_id": "150", "description": "Mercury inhibition of avian fatty acid synthetase complex.. (1) Subcutaneous or intra-abdominal injections of 8 mg of HgCl2/100 g body weight markedly depressed hepatic fatty acid synthetase activity of chicks at 1 h post-injection. The depression occurred despite the fact that the chicks continued to eat up until the time they were killed. Under these same conditions, the hepatic activity of acetyl-CoA carboxylase (EC 6.4.1.2) was not affected by HgCl2, while the activity of the mitochondrial system of fatty acid elongation was stimulated. (2) When 2-mercaptoethanol was included in the incubation medium for a highly purified preparation of fatty acid synthetase, 500 muM HgCl2 was required to show definite inhibition of the enzyme. When 2-mercaptoethanol was omitted, 50 muM HgCl2 was inhibitory and 100 muM HgCl2 abolished enzyme activity. (3) 2 mM dithiothreitol completely protected the purified fatty acid synthetase preparation from inhibition by 100 muM HgCl2. When dithiothreitol was added after the addition of enzyme to the mercury-containing medium, protection of the enzyme was not complete. (4) Dialysis of cytosol fractions from chicks injected with HgCl2 against 500 vol. of 0.2 M potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.0) containing 1 mM EDTA and 10 mM dithiothreitol for 4 h at 4 degrees stimulated the fatty acid synthetase activity of the fractions. Dialysis of cytosol fractions from noninjected chicks under the same conditions was without effect on fatty acid synthetase activity. (5) These data support the hypothesis that the inhibitory effect of HgCl2 administered in vivo on hepatic fatty acid synthetase activity in chicks is mediated through the interaction of mercury with the sulfhydryl groups of the enzyme."}

The influence of the sympathetic nervous system on the cerebral circulatory response to graded reductions in mean arterial blood pressure was studied in anesthetized baboons. Cerebral blood flow was measured by the 133Xe clearance method, and arterial blood pressure was decreased by controlled hemorrhage. In normal baboons, the constancy of cerebral blood flow was maintained until mean arterial blood pressure was approximately 65% of the base-line value; thereafter, cerebral blood flow decreased when arterial blood pressure was reduced. Superior cervical sympathectomy of 2-3 weeks duration did not affect the normal response. In contrast, both acute surgical sympathectomy (cervical trunk division) and alpha-receptor blockade (1.5 mg/kg of phenoxybenzamine) enhanced the maintenance of cerebral blood flow in the face of hemorrhagic hypotension in that cerebral blood flow did not decrease until mean arterial blood pressure was approximately 35% of the base-line value. The results indicate that the sympathetic nervous system is not involved in the maintenance of cerebral blood flow in the face of a fall in arterial blood pressure. Indeed, the implication is that the sympathicoadrenal discharge accompanying hemorrhagic hypotension is detrimental to, rather than responsible for,  cerebral autoregulation."}
{"_id": "154", "description": "Influence of hematocrit, blood gas tensions, and pH on pressure-flow relations in the isolated canine lung.. An isolated perfused canine lung preparation in which determinants of vascular caliber could be individually controlled was developed. The relation of pulmonary arterial (Pa), venous (PV), and alveolar (PA) pressures was such that Pa greater than PA greater than PV throughout the whole lung. The addition of isoprenaline to the perfusate abolished vascular reactivity. Once stability was reached, vascular cross-sectional area remained acceptably constant for 2.25 hours as judged by normalized conductance. The influence of perfusate hematocrit, blood gas tensions, and pH on pressure-flow relations was then studied in 15 isolated canine lungs. The hematocrit-vascular conductance relation was derived at constant perfusion pressure. Conductance varied linearly with hematocrit over a range of 16.5 to 89.5%. Mean pulmonary arterial blood gas tensions were: PO2 = 121 mm Hg, PCO2 = 28 mm Hg, and pH = 7.46. Acute respiratory acidosis (PO2 = 30 mm Hg, PCO2 = 81 mm Hg, pH = 7.17) and lactic acidosis and hypoxemia (PO2 = 32 mm Hg, PCO2 = 21 mm Hg, pH = 6.96) did not significantly alter this relation. Transformation of the conductance-hematocrit data indicated that hematocrit was the most important determinant of relative apparent viscosity of the blood. Both acute respiratory and lactic acidosis failed to significantly increase relative viscosity within the range of hematocrit usually found in secondary polycythemia."}
{"_id": "155", "description": "Interaction of the chemoreflex and the pulmonary inflation reflex in the regulation of coronary circulation in conscious dogs.. The interaction of chemoreflex and pulmonary inflation reflex control of the coronary circulation was examined in conscious dogs by comparing the responses to chemoreflex stimulation (intracarotid injection of nicotine) when ventilation was allowed to increase with those when ventilation was controlled. The responses were also compared with those elicited by both forced mechanical and spontaneous hyperinflation. When the heart rate was constant, intracarotidly administered nicotine induced an increase in the depth of respiration followed closely by an increase in late diastolic coronary flow from 48 +/- 2 to 106 +/- 8 ml/min and a reduction in late diastolic coronary resistance from 1.62 +/- 0.08 to 0.78 +/- 0.06 mm Hg/ml min-1. After beta-receptor and cholinergic blockade, a similar coronary dilation in response to nicotine occurred only when ventilation was allowed to increase. However, when ventilation was controlled, intracarotidly administered nicotine increased coronary resistance after combined beta-receptor and cholinergic blockade. The reflex coronary dilation was not observed after carotid sinus nerve section or after alpha-receptor blockade. Thus, nicotine stimulation of the carotid chemoreflex results in a striking coronary dilation that has two components. The minor component involves a chemoreflex with its efferent pathway in tthe vagi. The major component of coronary dilation follows an increase in the depth of respiration, and its efferent component appears to involve withdrawal of alpha-adrenergic constrictor tone. An almost identical period of reflex coronary dilation followed either forced mechanical or spontaneous hyperinflation in the conscious dog."}
{"_id": "156", "description": "Effect of coronary blood flow on glycolytic flux and intracellular pH in isolated rat hearts.. The rate of coronary blood flow was varied in isolated working rat heart preparations to determine its influence on the rate of glocose utilization, tissue high-energy phosphates, and intracellular pH. A 60% reduction in coronary blood flow resulted in a 30% reduction in oxygen consumption, an accelerated rate of glusoe utilization, lower tissue levels of high-energy phosphate, and higher tissue levels of lactate and H+. Ventricular performance deteriorated as reflected by a decrease in heart rate and peak systolic pressure. Further reductions in coronary blood flow resulted in inhibition of glycolysis, a greater decrease in tissue levels of high-energy phosphates, and higher tissue levels of both lactate and H+. These changes in glycolytic flux, tissue metabolites, and ventricular performance were proportional to the degree of restriction in coronary blood flow. The importance of coronary blood flow and washout of the interstitial space in the maintenance of accelerated glycolytic flux in oxygen-deficient hearts is emphasized. It is concluded that acceleration of ATP production from glycolysis can occur only in the marginally ischemic tissue in the peripheral area of tissue supplied by an occluded artery. The central area of tissue which receives a low rate of coronary blood flow will have a reduced rate of ATP production due to both a lack of oxygen and an inhibition of glycolysis."}
{"_id": "157", "description": "Mechanisms of glycolytic inhibition in ischemic rat hearts.. The mechanisms of glycolytic inhibition in ischemic myocardium were investigated in the isolated, perfused rat heart. Glycolysis was inhibited at the level of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase. The major factors that accounted for the glycolytic inhibition in the ischemic heart compared with the anoxic heart appeared to be higher tissue levels of lactate and H+ in the ischemic tissue. Increased extracellular pH inhibited glycolysis in anoxic and hypoxic hearts much more readily than it did in aerobic hearts. However, maintenance of both extracellular and intracellular pH caused only a modest acceleration of glycolysis in ischemic hearts. Accumulation of tissue lactate and inhibition of glycolysis were directly proportional to the reduction in coronary bloow flow in both anoxic and ischemic hearts. At intracellular lactate concentrations between 15 and 20 mM, glycolysis was inhibited under both conditions. Addition of either 10, 20, or 40 mM lactate to the perfusate inhibited glycolysis in aerobic, anoxic, and ischemic hearts. The effect of lactate did not appear to be mediated through changes in intracellular pH. It is concluded that accumulation of lactate represents a major factor in the inhibition of glycolysis that develops in ischemic hearts."}
{"_id": "158", "description": "Comparison of contractile performance of canine atrial and ventricular muscles.. This study compared the contractile performance of a canine right atrial trabecula with that of a macroscopically indistinguishable trabecula isolated from the right ventricular apex. The heart was removed from nine mongrel puppies weighing 6-8 kg and placed in Krebs-Ringer's bicarbonate solution. The bathing solution contained only 1.25 mmoles of Ca2+ and was bubbled with a 95% O2-5% CO2 gas mixture. Each atrial trabecula was specially selected from the right atrial appendage. Histologically, these trabeculae showed a remarkable longitudinal orientation of the fibers. At Lmax (the length of the muscle at which developed tension was maximum) under identical conditions of temperature, rate of stimulation, ionic milieu, pH, and O2 and CO2 supply, right atrial trabeculae achieved the same developed and total tensions but in a much shorter time than did ventricular trabeculae. In both muscle groups the maximum developed tension averaged about 2.5 g/mm2. Since Lo (expressed as a fraction of Lmax) was less in atrial muscle than it was in ventribular muscle, we concluded that atrial muscle can be stretched considerably more than can ventricular muscle before optimum length is reached. At any given initial muscle length, the maximum of tension rise for atrial trabeculae amounted to at least twice that for ventricular trabeculae. At any given load up to 1.5 g/mm2, the maximum velocity of shortening of an atrial trabecula was about three to four times that of a ventricular trabecula. These results collectively indicate that the contractile performance of the right atrial muscle is in many respects superior to that of the right ventricle, at least under the conditions of these experiments."}

Correct differentiations for single ratios ranged from virtually nil for hydroxypyruvate/alpha-oxobutyrate to is greater than 93 per cent for glyoxylate/hydroxypyruvate and glyoxylate/alpha-oxobutyrate. This was little improved by the use of multiple ratios involving up to seven separate assays. 3.

The feasibility of using isoelectric focusing for the separation of primate pituitary growth hormone from prolactin and for the characterization of polymorphic forms of these hormones was explored. In a pH 3--10 gradient, extracts of both human and cynomolgus monkey pituitaries were each resolved into 4 growth hormone components and at least 3 prolactin components, as shown by radioimmunoassay. In narrower gradients (of 2--3 pH units) greater resolution was achieved; the principal growth hormone components were well separated from the principal prolactin components but there was overlapping of some minor components. A partially purified human prolactin preparation was found to contain 4 prolactin components, one of which had a prolactin/growth hormone ratio of 760. Clinical grade human growth hormone was also resolved into at least 5 prolactin and 5 growth hormone components, many of which had higher pI values than those found in pituitary extract. Under the conditions used, both growth hormone and prolactin were found to be polymorphic with respect to isoelectric point. Some of the human prolactin components were found to contain less than 0.2% growth hormone by radioimmunoassay. Monkey growth hormone containing 0.01% prolactin was isolated. These findings demonstrate that isoelectric focusing is useful for the preparation of both growth hormone and prolactin which are essentially free of one another. Furthermore, the polymorphic forms were repeatedly found in preparations obtained by several methods and from 2 different species, suggesting that these forms are not artifacts."}

Certain climatic and edaphic conformations in the Bavarian sub-alpine mountains and in the Alps favor above all the development of a land utilization system and farm structures similar to those in the northern part of Scandinavia. In 1963/64, the years of the highest environmental contamination up to the present, we established in 600 beef samples from the round or shoulder of male and female cattle (mainly Highland cattle) close connections between the 137Cs-contamination of green crop and the long lastnig yearly precipitation quantities, as well as certain relations between the 137Cs-contamination of meat and differences in the feeding and keeping of the animals. During summer-seasons (April-October), beef of cattle from pastures with heavy rainfall (Alps) was contaiminated by 137Cs up to 15 times more than that of confined animals. Hereby the rate of 137Cs-contamination in the meat of grazing cattle was nearly proportional to the quantities of precipitation. When confined cattle were fed on pastures in autumn after harvesting for 2 to 3 weeks, a quick increase of 137Cs-contamination of the meat was caused within this time up to values which in this district were otherwise only observed in grazing cattle. The lower 137Cs-content in meat of cattle housed during the summer season is due to the more varied fodder, which is at that time less contaminated than green crop. During the winter season (November to March), the highest contaminations in the meat of confined (Bohemian Forest) or grazing cattle (Alps) was measured when the animals in these districts were almost exclusively fed with fodder from the own farmground or with leafy silage. The highest contamination was almost regularly noticed in January, February and March, as generally during these months the highly contaminated first cut hay is fed. Here the meat was often even more contaminated than that of grazing cattle. After the quick decrease of 137Cs in fallout noticed in the years 1964 and 1965, in 1965/66 a dependance in the 137Cs-contamination of beef on the methods of keeping and feeding could still be observed in only the extreme cases (Alps, Bavarian- and Bohemian Forest); though in general, meat of animals from districts with heavy rainfall was slightly more contaminated than meat of animals from regions with less precipitation."}
{"_id": "230", "description": "Liver microsomal beta-glucuronidase and UDP-glucuronyltransferase.. Both UDP-glucuronyltransferase (GT) and beta-glucuronidase (betaG) were assayed in untreated liver microsomes. Optimum assay conditions were established with rat liver microsomes using p-nitrophenol (pNP) and its glucuronide (pNPGA) at the pH optima of GT (7.5) and betaG (4.5). The activities of the two enzymes were compared using microsomes from rats, mice, pigs, cattle and horses, with pNP, pNPGA, and phenolphthalein as substrate, in the presence of various cofactors and inhibitors at pH 7.5 and 4.5. These data disclose pronounced differences with respect to species, substrate and other experimental conditions, thereby precluding the establishment of general optimum conditions. The two enzymes were also assayed under strictly identical conditions using pNP and pNPGA and rat liver microsomes at pH 7.5 in the presence and absence of UDP-glucuronate disodium (UDPGA), activators (ATP;UDP-N-acetylglucosamine) and inhibitors. When provided with a functional level of UDPGA, both enzymes proved active under those conditions, and a conjugation-deconjugation interplay was indicated. The two processes could be selectively and totally inhibited by Zn2+ and saccharolactone. The results suggest that conjugation-deconjugation-reconjugation cycles may be operative in the metabolism of drugs in vivo, taking place already at the level of the liver endoplasmic reticulum."}
{"_id": "231", "description": "Biochemical aspects of renal ammonia formation in metabolic acidosis.. In omnivorous creatures, the diet is acidogenic, especially as a result of the meat content, which gives rise to phosphoric and sulphuric acids, i.e., to metabolic acidosis. In the short term, metabolic acids are buffered by tissue proteins and bicarbonate (the 'alkali reserve'). In the longer term, acid must be excreted, or neutralized with base which is also generated from the diet, by conversion of dietary amino-nitrogen to ammonia. The final steps of this process occur in the kidney, which converts circulating glutamine to ammonia, and to carbon products such as glucose and carbon dioxide, by metabolic reactions which adapt during acidosis to generate more ammonia and maintain an increased renal ammonia content. The complex mechanisms which govern the formation of ammonia, glucose and carbon dioxide from glutamine, involving the reactions of amino acids, the tricarboxylic acid cycle, and gluconeogenesis, are reviewed."}

Serum, liver and renal gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase (GGT) activities were studied in four groups of rabbits: controls, rabbits with obstructive extrahepatic cholestasis, rabbits with obstructive anuria, and animals with combined obstructive extrahepatic cholestasis and obstructive anuria. Serum GGT was essentially increased in rabbits with obstructive extrahepatic cholestasis, showing peak values in the combined cholestasis + obstructive anuria group, and practically normal values in animals with anuria. Liver GGT was increased in both cholestasis groups, but the increase was less prominent than the increase in serum GGT and there was no correlation between them. In both anuric groups renal GGT was reduced, probably as a result of inhibited enzyme synthesis secondary to the altered conditions for adequate renal function. The results obtained are suggestive of a probable renal involvement in the formation of the serum GGT activity level."}

The mechanism responsible for the changes in serum and liver gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase (gamma-GT) activity was studied in a model of experimental hexachlorobenzene porphyria in rabbits. Porphyria followed the administration of hexachlorobenzene in doses of 280 mumol - kg-1 body weight, which were given daily through a gastric tube over a 20-day period. Serum gamma-GT activity and the activities of the lysosomal enzymes beta-N-acetylglucosaminidase and alpha-mannosidase were increased, whereas L-aspartate: 2-oxoglutarate aminotransferase and L-alanine: 2-oxoglutarate aminotransferase and L-alanine: 2-oxoglutarate aminotransferase remained unaltered. There was a considerable increase in liver microsomal protein, gamma-GT, cytochrome P-450, anilinehydroxylase, aminopyrine-demethylase and delta-aminolevulinic acid synthase. In the liver gamma-GT was detected in the microsomes as well as in the cytoplasm where enzymatic activity was higher. The high correlation coefficient between liver gamma-GT, cytochrome P-450 and delta-aminolevulinic acid synthase witnesses a hexachlorobenzene-induced gamma-GT formation in the liver. A statistically significant correlation between serum and liver gamma-GT activity was also found. These data strongly suggest that the increase in serum gamma-GT activity may result from the induction of the enzyme in the liver."}

Although there was a 9.8% increase in the 2,3 DPG content following exercise, there was a concomitant 9.4% increase in the hemoglobin level; therefore, when 2,3 DPG is expressed as a ratio to hemoglobin (See Article), there was no significant change as a result of exercise stress. It was suggested that three additive factors produced during strenuous exercise; decreased pH; increased hemoglobin concentration; and increased CO2 production result in by-product inhibition of 2,3 DPG synthesis. It is concluded that 2,3 DPG does not provide a physiologic benefit in the adaptation of the oxygen transport system to exercise."}

All the digestion products contain, like hemoglobin itself, at least two classes of binding sites, one of high, the others of low affinity. The pH dependence of the excess linewidth of the 35Cl minus NMR signal indicates that in the simple digests with either carboxypeptidase A or B, chloride is bound with high affinity at or near His-beta146-Asp-beta94 and at or near Val-alpha1-Arg-alpha141. The high-affinity sites show, in the case of the simple digests, a strong oxygen linkage which is lost in the forms digested with both carboxypeptidase A and B; this linkage may thus be correlated to the presence of conformational changes. Organic phosphates, like inositol hexaphosphate, show competition for some of the high-affinity chloride binding sites in hemoglobin and in the simple digests. This competition is likewise lost in the doubly digested hemoglobins."}

The intracellular pH was measured in growing Clostridium pasteurianum with and acid-base equilibrium distribution method. [14C]Dimethyloxazolidinedione, [14]methylamine and [14C]acetic acid were used as \"deltapH-indicators\". During growth the extracellular pH decreased from 7.1 to 5.1; simultaneously the intracellular pH changed from 7.5 to 5.9. Thus, the intracellular pH was more alkaline than the extracellular pH by 0.4 to 0.8 pH-units. 2. This pH gradient (interior alkaline) was abolished by the proton conductor carbonylcyanide m-chlorophenylhydrazone and the ATPase inhibitor N,N'-dicyclohexylcarbodiimide. The pH gradient could not be demonstrated in cells depleted of an energy substrate. These results suggest that the pH gradient is formed by an ATPase-driven extrusion of protons from the cells rather than by a Donnan potential. 3. Growth of the organism was inhibited by low concentrations of both carbonylcyanide m-chlorophenylhydrazone (5 muM) and dicyclohexylcarbodiimide (5 muM). This finding suggests that the pH gradient is essential for the growing cell as it may be required for substrate accumulation and other types of transport processes."}

Membranes of the bacterial form and the stable and unstable L-forms of Proteus mirabilis contain LD and DD-carboxypeptidase. The DD-carboxypeptidase is inhibited non-competitively by penicillin G. The enzyme of the bacterial form is highly penicillin-sensitive (Ki - 4 X 10(-9) M penicillin G). Inhibition is only partly reversible by treatment with penicillinase or by dialysis against buffer. In contrast, the DD-carboxypeptidase of the unstable L-form, grown in the presence of penicillin, is 175-fold less penicillin-sensitive (Ki = 7 X 10(7) M penicillin G). Inhibition is completely reversed by penicillinase or dialysis. After inhibition by penicillin and subsequent reactivation the penicillin sensitivity of the bacterial DD-carboxtpeptidase is similar to the sensitivity of the enzyme of the unstable L-form. The hypothesis is proposed that P. mirabilis contains two DD-carboxypeptidases of different penicillin sensitivity and with different mechanisms of penicillin binding. Peptidoglycan synthesis in the cell walls of the unstable L-form is probably carried out with the help of only one DD-carboxypeptidase, viz. the completely reactivatable enzyme with the lower penicillin sensitivity."}

NAD kinase was purified from pigeon liver by an improved procedure which included chromatography on phosphocellulose. The resultant preparation was homogeneous as judged by gel electrophoresis, but electrofocusing gave indications of heterogeneity. The enzyme appeared to be of molecular weight 270000, and to consist of subunits of molecular weight 34000; it may therefore be an octomer. Kinetic studies over a wide range of substrate concentrations revealed departures from Michaelis-Menten behaviour with the substrate NAD+; these were interpreted tentatively in terms of negative homotropic interactions between identical binding sites, since thermal and chemical inactivation studies revealed no evidence for more than one type of catalytic site. The significance of the kinetics and of the type of inhibition produced by NADPH is discussed in terms of the regulation of NAD kinase activity in vivo."}

The effect of acid-base alterations was analyzed using isolated rat hearts perfused at constant coronary perfusion pressure, and stimulated to contract at constant rat. The amount of shortening in the major axis and its derivative were measured to assess myocardial contractility. Both the 'respiratory' and 'metabolic' alterations affected the contractile behavior to the same extent. In the physiological range studied by us, acidosis depresses and alkalosis increases myocardial contraction. However acidosis seems to depress contractility more than the enhancement produced by the same change in pH towards the alkalotic side. When either amount of shortening or max dl/dt was plotted as a function of hydrogen ion acitvity (aH+) a linear correlation was obtained, either with pure 'metabolic' or 'respiratory' acid-base induced alterations (correlation coefficients higher than -.95; P less than .01). Our findings suggest that in the range studied by us, contraction of the perfused rat heart following acid-base alterations, is a linear function of hydrogen ion activity."}

A sulfonamide-resistant mutant of pneumococcus, sulr-c, displays a genetic instability, regularly segregating to wild type. DNA extracts of derivatives of the strain possess transforming activities for both the mutant and wild-type alleles, establishing that the strain is a partial diploid. The linkage of sulr-c to strr-61, a stable chromosomal marker, was established, thus defining a chromosomal locus for sulr-c. DNA isolated from sulr-c cells transforms two mutant recipient strains at the same low efficiency as it does a wild-type recipient, although the mutant property of these strains makes them capable of integrating classical \"low-efficiency\" donor markers equally as efficiently as \"high efficiency\" markers. Hence sulr-c must have a different basis for its low efficiency than do classical low efficiency point mutations. We suggest that the DNA in the region of the sulr-c mutation has a structural abnormality which leads both to its frequent segregation during growth and its difficulty in efficiently mediating genetic transformation."}
{"_id": "271", "description": "Recombination as a requirement for segregation of a partially diploid mutant of Pneumococcus.. Conditions are described in which the pneumococcal mutant strain sulr-c, resistant to the drug sulfanilamide, gives rise to sensitive segregants resistant to nitrobenzoic acid at a frequency constant with time. This segregant frequency is markedly enhanced upon exposure of the cells to doses of ultraviolet light or mitomycin C that permit survival of 50% to 90% of the cells. Treatment with acridine orange diminishes the segregant frequency. From the known influences of these three agents on genetic recombination, we propose that a recombination event is necessary in the generation of segregants.--During a period of incubation following treatment with ultraviolet light or mitomycin C, cell division resumes and the original segregant frequency is restored. Thus potential segregants are either unable to replicate in the absence of selection, or they are under-represented among the cells dividing soon after treatment.--If the sulr-c mutation is introduced into a mutant pneumococcal strain lacking an ATP-dependent exonuclease activity and deficient in recombination with transforming DNA, segregant frequencies are unaffected. This fact may indicate limits upon the type of recombination event responsible for segregation."}

Bottle-fed controls had low pH values and low bacterial concentrations, whereas infants with chronic diarrhoea and protein-calorie malnutrition had high pH values and bacterial overgrowth, essentially of Gram-negative bacilli. After recovery, the only remaining alteration was the frequent isolation of yeast-like fungi in low concentrations. Infants with acute diarrhoea, except for the isolation more frequently of yeast-like fungi, presented no alterations; this seems to indicate that pH alterations and Gram-negative bacilli overgrowth occurred during the evolution of the disease to a chronic state. Breast-fed normal infants had hydrogen-ion concentrations similar to those of the chronic diarrhoea group, but without Gram-negative bacilli overgrowth, suggesting that other factors, besides pH, regulate bacterial growth in the gastric contents of these groups of infants."}

A combination of two or more drugs may exert a drug-drug interaction, in which case the effect can be potentiated or antagonized. Such synergistic effects are well known in the case of pyrabital (barbital + aminopyrine) or irgapyrine (phenylbutazone + aminopyrine). Bucolome (BCP), a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agent, has the chemical structure of a barbiturate and also resembles the formula of pheylbutazone. Thus the influence of BCP combination on the pharmacological activities of various pyrazolone derivatives was examined. BCP potentiated the analgesic and antipyretic effects of 4-aminoantipyrine (4A), methylaminoantipyrine (MA), aminopyrine (AM) and isopropylaminoantipyrine (IPA), which were substituted by the alkylamino group at 4-position of the pyrazolone ring. This potentiation occurred when the dose of BCP exceeded that of the pyrazolones, and was especially marked when combination ratio of BCP exceeded that of the pyrazolones, and was especially marked when combination ratio of BCP and pyrazolone was 2:1 mola. The analgesic effects of antipyrine (AN), isopropylantipyrine (IP) and aminopropylone (AP), which were substituted by alkyl group or aminoacylamino group at 4-position, were not potentiated by BCP in any combination ratio. Most pyrazolones showed additive acute toxicity in their combination with BCP, but acute toxicities of 4A and AM, which were potentiated in analgesic effects, were decreased and antagonized when combined with BCP. The plasma concentration of AM was increased and prolonged by BCP, while that of IP remained much the same. These results suggest that the pharmacological activities are associated with certain molecular interactions between BCP and pyrazolones, which are substituted by the alkylamino group at 4-position of the pyrazolone ring."}
{"_id": "282", "description": "[Combined use of bucolome and pyrazolone derivatives (II). Complex formation due to interaction between bucolome and pyrazolones].. We have already reported that bucolome (BCP), a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agent, potentiates significantly the analgesic and antipyretic effects of pyrazolones which are substituted by alkylamino group at 4-position of the pyrazolone ring. Physical and quantum chemistry were applied to the mechanism of this synergistic action. The solubility of BCP was markedly increased in proportion to elevation of aminopyrine (AM) concentration, but not by a combination with isopropylantipyrine (IP). The binding of BCP to bovine serum albumin was slightly inhibited by AM, but not by IP. The mixture of AM and BCP in aqueous media generated optical absorption in the ultraviolet differential spectrum, due to the charge transfer interaction. The results of the infrared or NMR spectrum demonstrated the formation of a hydrogen binding in non-aqueous media between BCP and AM. From the calculation of the charge on an atom, the energy of the highest occupied molecular orbital and the frontier electron density, BCP is considered to be a good electron acceptor. The beta-units of Mho of pyrazolones were found to correlate with the potentiation coefficient of analgesic activity in combination drugs. These results suggest that the complex formation between BCP and pyrazolones is an important factor for the synergism of action and is due to the charge transfer interaction and the hydrogen binding of both molecules."}

The kinetics and cellular characteristics of immunosuppression in (CBA-p X C57/Bl)F1 mice during graft-versus-host (GVH) reaction induced with spleen cells from either parental strain have been investigated. Effects on PFC responses to thymus-dependent (chicken red blood cells) and independent (levan) antigens have been compared. The unresponsive state which developed in GVH mice was expressed to comparable extent by their spleen cells following transfer to irradiated recipients. Furthermore, GVH spleen cells suppressed normal spleen cells in a mixed transfer system, but this effect was lost completely by day 21 whereas the original donors (or their cells) were still totally refractory after 80 days. This active suppressor effect was found to be mediated by T cells of perental origin based on cell fractionation analysis and selective deletion of donor or host cells by alloimmune attack. The delayed transfer of GVH cells to irradiated repopulated recipients challenged with antigen, indicated that suppressor T cells exert an anti-mitotic influence on antigen-stimulated B-cell proliferation. Supplementation of macrophage-depleted, anti-theta-treated GVH spleen cells with purified normal T cells demonstrated that B cells in GVH mice are normally reactive even when active suppression by T cells is no longer demonstrable. The likelihood that this later phase of immunosuppression is attributable to another mechanism is discussed."}

To study the importance of this interaction to human disease, complement consumption by pneumococci of various serotypes was measured in humwn serum chelated with ethyleneglycoltraacetic acid, a substance that blocks the classic but not the alternate complement pathwway. Serotype I, in contrast to all other types studied, lacked ability to consume complement in this system. The ability for serotypes III, IV, and VIII to activate the alternate pathway could be eliminated by prior serum absorption at O C with they type in question, a condition that would remove antibody but not complement. Types VII, XII, XIV, and XXV readily activated the alternate pathway in unabsorbed and absorbed sera. Differences could not be related to properties of the capsules. It was concluded that types I, III, IV, and VIII lack intrinsic ability to activate and thus be opsonized by the alternate complement pathway, although types III, IV, and VIII can do so in concert with specific antibody. The fact that these same types are especially prominent in human disease suggests that the ability to evade opsonization by the alternate complement pathway in pre-antibody phases of infection may be a virulence factor in pneumococci."}

Antigenically stimulated H37Ra-immunized mouse spleen cells required 72 h of incubation to produce supernatant fluids that would cause intracellular inhibition. Supernatant fluids from 48-h mouse spleen cell cultures were not able to produce intracellular inhibition. Investigation of the culture conditions showed that at lease 1.0% human serum was required in the tissue culture medium for the production of MycoIF by spleen cells from immunized mice. MycoIF activity was noted only in supernatant fluids from spleen cell cultures incubated with antigen for 72 h. MycoIF was nondialyzable and unaffected by freezing, lyophilization, or incubation at 60 C for 30 min. However, MycoIF was inactivated after incubation at 80 C for 30 min. MycoIF was unaffected by low hydrogen ion concentrations (pH 7 to 12), but exposure to higher hydrogen ion concentrations (pH 6, pH 5) significantly decrease MycoIF activity, and exposure to pH 4 to 2 abolished all activity.

Clotting times of PPP and PRP from C6-deficient animals were likewise decreased. The bacteria had no effect on the  one-stage prothrombin time or the partial thromboplastin time when the organisms were used as activating agents. Platelets aggregated in the presence of pneumococci,  but aggregation was prevented by the addition of cyclic adenosine 3', 5'-monophosphate (cAMP). Furthermore, cAMP corrected the shortened clotting time of PRP in the presence of pneumococci. The clumping and release of polymorphonuclear coagulant that was induced by pneumococci was not prevented by cAMP. Thus, pneumococci exert several dose-dependent thromboplastic effects: (i) release of platelet thromboplastic substances; (ii) a direct thromboplastic effect; and (iii) release of polymorphonuclear coagulant."}

{"_id": "333", "description": "Phenomenon of hot-cold hemolysis: chelator-induced lysis of sphingomyelinase-treated erythrocytes.. Staphylococcus aureus produces a phospholipase C specific for sphingomyelin (beta-hemolysin). Erythrocytes with approximately 50% sphingomyelin in their membranes, e.g., from sheep, have been shown to have up to 60% of this phospholipid hydrolyzed by this enzyme at 37 C in isotonic buffered saline without hemolysis. Cooling of sphingomyelinase C-treated erythrocytes to 4 C causes complete lysis of the cells, a phenomenon known as hot-cold hemolysis. The addition of ethylenediaminetetraacetate (EDTA) to sheep erythrocytes preincubated with sphingomyelinase C was found to induce rapid hemolysis at 37 C. The treated cells became susceptible to chelator-induced hemolysis and to hot-cold hemolysis simultaneously, and the degree of lysis of both mechanisms increased equally with prolonged preincubation with sphingomyelinase C. Erythrocytes of species not readily susceptible to hot-cold hemolysis were equally insusceptible to chelator-induced lysis. Chelators of the EDTA series were the most effective, whereas chelators more specific for Ca2+, Zn2+, Fe2+, Cu2+, and Mg2+ were without effect. The rate of chelator-induced lysis was dependent on the preincubation period with beta-hemolysin and on the concentration of chelator added. The optimal concentration of EDTA was found to equal the amount of exogenously added Mg2+, a cation necessary for sphingomyelinase C activity. Hypotonicity increased the rate of chelator-induced hemolysis, whereas increasing the osmotic pressure to twice isotonic completely inhibited chelator-induced lysis. The data suggest that exogenously added and/or membrane-bound divalent cations are important for the stability of sphingomyelin-depleted membranes. The phenomenon of hot-cold hemolysis may be a consequence of the temperature dependence of divalent ion stabilization."}

A previously unrecognized enzyme, citrate lyase deacetylase, has been purified about 140-fold from cell extracts of Rhodopseudomonas gelatinosa. It catalyzed the conversion of enzymatically active acetyl-S-citrate lyase into the inactive HS-form and acetate. The enzyme exhibited an optimal rate of inactivation at pH 8.1. Because of the instability of acetyl-S-citrate lyase at acidic and alkaline pH values, all assays were carried out at pH 7.2, where the spontaneous hydrolysis of the acetyl-S-citrate lyase was negligible and deacetylase showed 70% of the activity at pH 8.1. The apparent Km value for citrate lyase was 10(-7) M at pH 7.2 and 30 C. The activity of the deacetylase was restricted to the citrate lyase from R. gelatinosa. The corresponding lyases from Enterobacter aerogenes (formerly Klebsiella aerogenes) and Streptococcus diacetilactis were not deacetylated; likewise, thioesters such as acetyl-S coenzyme A, acetoacetyl-S coenzyme A, and N-acetyl-S-acetyl-cysteamine were also not hydrolyzed. Citrate lyase deacetylase was present in very small amounts in cells of R. gelatinosa grown with acetate or succinate; it was induced by citrate along with the citrate lyase. L-(+)-Glutamate strongly inhibited the deacetylase. Fifty percent inhibition was obtained at a concentration of 1.4 X 10(-4) L-(+)-glutamate. D-(-)-Glutamate, alpha-ketoglutarate, L-alpha-hydroxyglutarate, L-(-)-proline, and other metabolites were less effective."}
{"_id": "357", "description": "Novel type of murein transglycosylase in Escherichia coli.. The purification and properties of a novel type of murein transglycosylase from Escherichia coli are described. The purified enzyme appears as a single band on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gels and has an apparent molecular weight of approximately 65,000 as estimated by gel filtration and gel electrophoresis. It degrades pure murein sacculi from E. coli almost completely into low-molecular-weight products. The two prominent muropeptide fragments in the digest are the disaccharide-tripeptide N-acetylglucosamine-N-acetylmuramic acid-L-alanine-D-iso-glutamic acid-meso-diaminopimelic acid and the corresponding disaccharide-tetrapeptide N-acetylglucosamine-N-acetylmuramic acid-L-alanine-D-iso-glutamic acid-meso-diaminopimelic acid-D-alanine. The unique feature of these compounds is that the disaccharide has no reducing end group and that the muramic acid residue possesses an internal 1 leads to 6 anhydro linkage. The new lytic enzyme is designated as a murein: murein transglycosylase. Its possible role in the rearrangement of murein during cell growth and division is discussed."}

The cells accumulate molybdate against a concentration gradient, and the uptake shows a marked dependence on temperature (optimum 37 C) and pH (optimum 6.0). The rate of molybdate uptake with increasing molybdate concentrations shows saturation kinetics with an apparent Km and Vmax of 4.8 X 10(-5) M and 55 nmol/g of dry cells per min, respectively.

The cellular localization of enzymes in Diplococcus pneumoniae was examined by fractionation of spheroplasts. A deoxyribonuclease implicated in the entry of deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) into the cell during genetic transformation was located in the cell membrane. This enzyme, the major endonuclease of the cell (endonuclease I), which is necessary for the conversion of donor DNA to single strands inside the cell and oligonucleotides outside, thus could act at the cell surface. Another enzyme, the cell wall lysin (autolysin), was also found in the membrane fraction. Other enzymes, including amylomaltase, two exonucleases, and adenosine triphosphate-dependent deoxyribonuclease, and a restriction type endonuclease, were located in the cytosol within the cell. None of the enzymes examined were predominantly periplasmic in location. Spheroplasts were obtained spontaneously on incubation of pneumococcal cells in concentrated sugar solutions. The autolytic enzyme appears to be involved in this process. Cells that were physiologically competent to take up DNA formed osmotically sensitive spheroplasts two to three times faster than cells that were not in the competent state. Although some genetically incompetent mutants also formed spheroplasts more slowly, other such mutants formed them at the faster rate."}

The first committed step of aromatic amino acid biosynthesis in Salmonella typhimurium was shown to be catalyzed by three isoenzymes of 3-deoxy-D-arabino-heptulosonic acid 7-phosphate (DAHP) synthase. Mutations in each of the genes specifying the isoenzymes were isolated and mapped. aroG, the structural gene for the phenylalanine-inhibitable isoenzyme, was linked to gal, and aroH, the structural gene for the tryptophan-inhibitable isoenzyme, was linked to aroE. aroF, the structural gene for the tyrosine-inhibitable isoenzyme, was linked to pheA and tyrA, which specify the phenylalanine- and tyrosine-specific branch-point enzymes, respectively. The phenylalanine-inhibitable isoenzyme was the predominant DAHP synthase in wild-type cells, and only the tryosine-inhibitable isoenzyme was completely repressed, as well as inhibited, by low levels of its allosteric effector. The DAHP synthase isoenzymes were separated by chromatography on diethylaminoethyl-cellulose with a phosphate gradient which contained enolpyruvate phosphate to protect the otherwise unstable phenylalanine-inhibitable isoenzyme. No cross-inhibition of either the tyrosine- or phenylalanine-inhibitable isoenzyme was observed at inhibitor concentrations up to 1 mM. The tryptophan-inhibitable isoenzyme was partially purified from extracts of a strain lacking the other two isoenzymes and shown to be inhibited about 30% by 1 mM tryptophan.

As isolated, the enzyme contains flavine adenine dinucleotide and a tightly bound metal cofactor. Inactivation by ortho-phenanthroline occurs in two steps and is partially blocked by D-lactate. Reactivation by divalent metal ions occurs, with divalent zinc being the most effective. When ferricyanide is used as the electron acceptor, D-lactate has an apparent K0.5 of 3.3 M0.46; its binding is negatively cooperative with a Hill coefficient of 0.46. Replacement of ferricyanide by the other components of the electron transport system yields hyperbolic kinetics with an apparent Km for D-lactate of 26 mM. The apparent Km for ferricyanide is 2.2 X 10(-4) M. Phosphate and pyrophosphate compounds stimulate the D-lactate:ferricyanide activity.

Coenzyme A (CoA) transferase from Peptostreptococcus elsdenii has been purified and crystallized, and some of its properties have been established. The work was facilitated by a newly developed coupled and continuous spectrophotometric assay in which the disappearance of added acrylate could be followed at 245 nm. The rate-limiting conversion of acetyl- and beta-hydroxypropionyl CoA to acrylyl CoA by CoA transferase was followed by the non-rate-limiting conversion to beta-hydroxypropionyl CoA by excess crotonase. Thus, a small priming quantity of acetyl CoA served to generate acrylyl CoA, which, by hydration, generated beta-hydroxypropionyl CoA. This product then served to generate more acrylyl CoA in cyclic fashion. The net result was the CoA transferase-limited conversion of acrylate to beta-hydroxypropionate. The purified transferase has a molecular weight of 125,000 and is composed of two subunits of 63,000 each, as determined by disc gel electrophoresis. Short-chain-length monocarboxylic acids are substrates, whereas dicarboxylic or beta-ketocarboxylic acids are not. The reaction kinetics are typical of a ping-pong bi bi mechanism composed of two half reactions linked by a covalent enzyme intermediate. Incubation of the transferase with acetyl CoA in the absence of a fatty acid acceptor yielded a stable intermediate which, by absorption spectrophotometry, radioactivity measurements, reduction with borohydride, reactivity with hydroxylamine, and catalytic activity, was identified as an enzyme-CoA compound. Kinetic constants for CoA transferase are: final specific activity, 110 U/mg of protein corresponding to 1.38 X 10(4) mumol of acrylate activated per mumol of transferase; Km for acrylate, 1.2 X 10(-3) M; Km for acetyl CoA (beta-hydroxypropionyl CoA), 2.4 X 10(-5) M."}

Studies were made on the physical and chemical properties of polysaccharides synthesized by cell-free extracts of Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus sanguis, and Streptococcus sp. and their susceptibilities to dextranases. Among the polysaccharides examined, insoluble glucans were rather resistant to available dextranase preparations, and the insoluble, sticky glucan produced by S. mutans OMZ 176, which could be important in formation of dental plaques, was the most resistant. By enrichment culture of soil specimens, using OMZ 176 glucans as the sole carbon source, an organism was isolated that produced colonies surrounded by a clear lytic zone on opaque agar plates containing the OMZ 176 glucan. The organism was identified as a strain of Flavobacterium and named the Ek-14 bacterium. EK-14 bacterium was grown in Trypticase soy broth, and an enzyme capable of hydrolyzing the OMZ 176 glucan was concentrated from the culture supernatant and purified by negative adsorption on a diethylaminoethyl-cellulose (DE-32) column and gradient elution chromatography with a carboxymethyl-cellulose (CM-32) column. The enzyme was a basic protein with an isoelectric point of pH 8.5 and molecular weight of 65,000. Its optimum pH was 6.3 and its optimal temperature was 42 C. The purified enzyme released 11% of the total glucose residues of the OMZ 176 glucan as reducing sugars and solubilized about half of the substrate glucan.

A deoxyribonuclease, which requires nucleoside triphosphate for reaction, has been purified about 150-fold from extracts of Bacillus laterosporus. Potassium phosphate and ethylene glycol stabilize the purified enzyme. The enzyme degrades double-stranded DNA about 100 times faster than heat-denatured DNA in the presence of nucleoside triphosphate. Double-stranded DNA is not degraded to any measurable extent in the absence of ATP, but the enzyme exhibits activity toward denatured DNA in the absence of nucleoside triphosphate, and this activity seems to be an intrinsic property of this enzyme protein. The optimum pH is 8.5 and the maximum activity is obtained in the copresence of Mg2+ (8.0 X 10(-3)M) and Mn2+ (7.0 X 10(-5)M). ATP and dATP are most effective and nucleoside di- or monophosphates are ineffective. ATP is converted to ADP and inorganic phosphate during the reaction and the ratio of the amount of ATP cleaved to that of hydrolyzed phosphodiester bonds of DNA is about 3:1. An inhibitor of the enzyme was observed in bacterial extracts prepared by sonic disruption; the inhibitory substance is produced in the bacteria in the later stages of cell growth.

Tryptophan was administered to rats under various nutritional conditions: fasted for 24 hr, fasted and refed with glucose or corn-oil, fasted and administered glycerol intramuscularly, and nonfasted. 2. The changes in the contents of glycolytic intermediates in the livers indicated that the phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase [EC 4.1.1.32] reaction is inhibited by tryptophan administration in all groups of rats. The inversely related changes in the contents of malate and phosphoenolpyruvate were associated with the accumulation of quinolinate in the livers. The content of quinolinate which exhibited the half-maximal effect on the contents of both metabolites was 0.1-0.2 mumole per g liver. 3. The rate of incorporation of 3H from 3H2O into the total hepatic fatty acids was increased about 2-fold by the administration of this amino acid to the fasted rats. The enhancement of the rate was closely related to the increase in the citrate content. The hyperlipogenesis was also related to the decrease of acetyl-CoA and the increase of malonyl-CoA. The content of long-chain acyl-CoA was not affected. These effects of tryptophan administration on the hepatic fatty acid metabolism were found in all groups of rats. The liver content of glycerol 3-phosphate was decreased by tryptophan administration was markedly increased by glycerol injection. The injection of glycerol into the control and the tryptophan-treated rats produced a marked increase of glycerol 3-phosphate but did not affect the rate of fatty acid synthesis in the livers of either group. 4. It may be concluded that, in the livers of rats under various nutritional conditions, the short-term control of fatty acid synthesis by tryptophan administration is most likely due to the activation of acetyl-coenzyme A carboxylase [EC 6.4.1.2] by citrate."}
{"_id": "376", "description": "Electrophoretic investigations of the acid conformational change of alpha-lactalbumin.. In order to clarify how the electrophoretic behavior reflects the conformational transition of globular proteins, moving boundary electrophoresis was applied to analysis of the acid conformational change of alpha-lactalbumin. The appearance of only a single electrophoretic boundary in the transition region of the protein suggests a very rapid transition with a half-time estimated to be smaller than 7 min on the basis of the theory of isomerizing systems in electrophoresis. The transition is clearly reflected in the dependence of the mobility on the protein net charge, which shows a sigmoidal curve closely similar to that obtained by a Linderstrøm-Lang pH-tritration plot for the carboxyl groups of alpha-lactalbumin. It was also concluded from the transition curves that the acidfication does not result in complete unfolding, but that a compact structure is maintained in the acidic region with an apparently expanded form as compared to the native state of the protein. All results obtained by electrophoresis were also supported by the results of pH-jump studies, analytical gel chromatography, and CD measurements."}

The multiple forms of cathepsin A (AI, AII, and AIII) purified from the lysosome fraction of rat liver by Sephadex G-200 and DEAE-Sephadex chromatographies were studied comparatively. Forms AI, AII and AIII were stable between pH 3.0 and 5.5, and had pH optima for CBZ-Glu-Phe at 5.6, 5.8, and 5.9, respectively. These activities were rapidly lost on heating above 60 degrees. Their isoelectric points were at 4.7, 4.8, and 4.9, and the Michaelis constants for CBZ-Glu-Phe were calculated as 10, 6.6, and 4.2 X 10(-4)M, respectively. Activity was inhibited by Ag+, Au3+, Hg2+, iodine, and p-chloromercuribenzoate (PCMB). Diisopropyl fluorophosphate (DFP), phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride (PMSF), toluenesuffonyl fluoride (TSF), and sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) were inhibitory at a concentration of 10(-3)M. Soybean trypsin inhibitor, pepstatin, leupeptins, and antipain were not inhibitory, while chymostatin caused slight inhibition. No distinct difference was observed in the effects of these compounds on the multiple forms of cathepsin A despite differences in the molecular weights of these forms (100,000, 200,000, and 420,000, respectively). In immuno-diffusion analysis, cathepsin AI, AII, and AIII which had been treated with EDTA, dithiothreitol, PCMB, and a high concentration of NaCl, gave the same precipitin patterns as the untreated enzymes, but treatment with 6 M urea caused a slight alteration of the pattern. After SDS-treatment (50 mM or more), the precipitin lines of these multiple forms fused and gave a single, identical line. This suggests that the different forms of the cathepsin A are all composed of subunits which are immunologically identical or closely related, and that the subunits are mainly bound by hydrophobic forces. This conclusion is supported by results obtained by poliacrylamide gel electrophoresis in the presence of SDS."}

The flavin which was extracted by hot methanol from the inactivated enzyme was identical with authentic FAD by thin-layer chromatography and circular dichroism. The excitation spectrum of emission at 520 nm of the released flavin was very similar to the absorption spectrum of oxidized FAD. The released flavin was reduced by potassium borohydride. The apoenzyme prepared after propargylglycine treatment did not show restored D-amino acid oxidase activity on adding exogenous FAD. The absorption spectrum of this inactivated apoenzyme showed absorption peaks at 279 and 317 nm, and a shoulder at about 290 nm. These results strongly indicate that the inactivation reaction is a dynamic affinity labeling with D-propargylglycine which produces irreversible inactivation of the enzyme by a covalent modification of an amino acid residue at the active site."}

The final purified preparation of the inhibitor was found to be homogeneous by both chromatographic and electrophoretic analysis. The inhibitor was thermostable and was stable over the broad pH range from 2 to 11. No inhibition was observed by heavy metal ions and many reagents at 10(-2) M, except that p-chloromercuribenzoate caused a 69% loss of activity. The inhibitor was subjected to isoelectric focusing at pH 7.51 and its molecular weight was calculated to be 14,200+/-900 by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in the presence of sodium dodecyl sulfate. The apparent dissociation constant for the complex between the inhibitor and trypsin[EC 3.4.21.4] was 1.64 X 10(-7)M with casein as a substrate. One microgram of purified inhibitor inhibited 1.5 mug of pure trypsin in the hydrolysis of alpha-N-benzoyl-DL-arginine-p-nitroanilide.

The binding of triiodothyronine by Rana catesbeiana tadpole tail fin, tail muscle, kidney, and liver cytosol was studied using dextran-coated charcoal to separate bound and free hormone. A metal ion dependency was suggested by the fact that EDTA decreased the binding of triiodothyronine 80 to 90% in tail fin and tail muscle cytosol. Inhibition of binding in kidney or liver was less, 40 to 50%. This inhibition could be restored by adding an excess of divalent cations with an order of potency of Mn2+ greater than Ca2+ congruent to Co2+ greater than Sr2+ greater than Ba2+ greater than Mg2+. Other chelators, e.g. o-phenanthroline, 8-hydroxyquinoline, and ethylene glycol bis(beta-aminoethylether)-N,N'-tetraacetate also decreased the binding of triiodothyronine, whereas citrate, oxalate, imidazole, and glycine had no effect. The triiodothyronine binding capacity of tail fin cytosol was reduced by EDTA treatment and dialysis against buffer. Ca2+ in the 1 to 10 mM range and Mn2+ at 1 mM could restore the binding to normal levels. Higher Mn2+ increased binding 70% above normal or to Ca2+-restored levels.

Cytochrome P-450 from bovine adrenocortical mitochondria exists in three forms of molecular weight: 850,000 (protein 16), of one-half (protein 8), and of one-quarter of this value (protein 4). The forms of the enzyme are named according to the number of subunits and all appear to be active in converting cholesterol to 3beta-hydroxy-5-pregnen-20-one (side chain cleavage) (Shikita, M., and Hall, P.F. (1973) J. Biol. Chem. 248, 5606). To determine whether all three forms are active at their characteristic molecular weights, the three cytochromes were each layered onto separate sucrose density gradients and centrifuged at 49,000 rpm for 60 min; the gradients contained all the factors necessary for side chain cleavage including one of the following substrates: cholesterol, 20S-hydroxycholesterol, and 20S,22R-dihydroxycholesterol. Regardless of the form of P-450 layered onto the gradient and regardless of the substrate, enzyme activity (side chain cleavage) was observed only in fractions corresponding to a sedimentation coefficient of 20 to 22 S which is that for protein 16. No activity was observed at S values corresponding to either protein 8 or protein 4. These findings indicate that the active form of cytochrome P-450 from adrenocortical mitochondria is that containing 16 subunits, i.e. the form in which the cytochrome is normally isolated from adrenal mitochondria. Forms consisting of eight and four subunits which can be prepared from protein 16 become active only by forming protein 16, at least in an aqueous medium in vitro."}

Clostridium perfringens sialidase was purified by affinity chromatography. Kinetic properties of the enzyme were examined with sialyllactose and with mixed sialoglycolipids (gangliosides) as substrates. With the latter substrate in 0.01 M Tris-acete in the absence of strong electrolyte, the pH optimum for enzymatic activity was 6.8. Addition of strong electrolyte (0.01 to 0.10 M Nac1) to the reaction medium caused an acidic shift and a broadening of the pH optimum, Enzymatic activity at pH 5.8 rose approximately 2.5-fold; a concomitant loss of activity at pH 6.8 was also observed. The alteration of enzymatic activity caused by strong electrolyte were dependent upon changes in Vmax. Km remained nearly invariant. Thus, a reversible transition of the enzyme from a relatively inactive to a highly active form occurred as a function of strong electrolyte concentration. Determination of the pK values of the active functional groups of C. perfringens sialidase revealed that the effects of strong electrolyte were exerted upon the pKa group of the enzyme. Strong electrolyte appeared to shield unfavorable electrostatic interactions between polyanionic sialoglycolipid micelles and the enzyme molecule, thus protecting the pKa group from inactivation. In comparision with the effects of strong electrolyte upon enzymatic activity toward the sialoglycolipid substrate, those observed with the monovalent substrate, sialyllacthose, were minor. Collectively, these findings indicate that ionic environment may effectively control the activity and relative substrate specificity of C. perfringens sialidase at a given pH. Furthermore, they explain the low pH optima and skewed pH profiles previously reported for enzymatic activity toward high molecular weight substrates."}

Reduced coenzyme Q-cytochrome c reductase from bovine heart mitochondria (complex III) was incorporated into phospholipid vesicles by the cholate dialysis procedure. Soybean phospholipids or mixtures of purified phosphatidylcholine, phosphatidylethanolamine, and cardiolipin could be used. Oxidation of reduced coenzyme Q2 by the reconstituted vesicles with cytochrome c as oxidant showed the following energy-coupling phenomena. 1. Protons were translocated outward with a coupling ratio, H+/2e, of 1.9 +/- 0.2. Measurements with mitochondria under similar conditions showed an H+/2e ratio of 1.8. Proton translocation was not seen in the presence of uncoupling agents and was in addition to the net acidification of the medium from the over-all oxidation reaction. 2. Potassium ions were taken up by the reconstituted vesicles in the presence of valinomycin in a reaction coupled to electron transfer. The coupling ratio for K+ uptake, K+/2e, was 2.0 in the vesicles and approximately 1.5 in mitochondria. 3. The rate of oxidation of reduced coenzyme Q2 by the reconstituted vesicles was stimulated up to 10-fold by uncouplers or by valinomycin plus nigericin and K+ ions. Addition of valinomycin alone in a K+ medium caused a transient stimulation of electron transfer. The results indicate that energy coupling can be observed with isolated reduced coenzyme Q-cytochrome c reductase if the enzyme complex is properly incorporated into a phospholipid vesicle."}

Crude particulate preparations obtained from anaerobic, light-grown cells of Rhodopseudomonas spheroides have been shown to possess a significant level of sn-glycerol-3-phosphate acyltransferase (EC 2.3.1.15) activity. In contrast to the enzyme from Escherichia coli, the R. spheroides glycerophosphate acyltransferase has a high specificity for acyl thiolester derivatives of acyl carrier protein (ACP) as acyl donors for the reaction. Only limited , nonlinear glycerophosphate incorporation into lipid occurs when acyl coenzyme A (CoA) derivatives are employed as acyl substrate. With oleyl-ACP as substrate, maximal enzyme activity was observed at 40 degrees, over a broad pH range (6.0 to 8.5) and did not require a divalent metal cation. The presence of dithiothreitol stimulated enzyme-activity 15 to 20%. When oleyl-ACP or palmityl-ACP was employed as sole acyl group donor, the major products recoverable from the reaction mixtures were lysophosphatidic acid, phosphatidic acid, and monoglyceride.

The highly purified was homogeneous when subjected to polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, ultracentrifugation analyses, and immunochemical determinations. The weight average molecular weight as determined by sedimentation equilibrium ultracentrifugations was 54,000 and by sedimentation diffusion data 55,000.

Heterogeneities of the two ovalbumin glycopeptides, (Man)5(GlcNAc)2Asn and (Man)6(GlcNAc)2Asn, were revealed by borate paper electrophoresis of oligosaccharide alcohols obtained from the glycopeptides by endo-beta-N-acetylglucosaminidase H digestion and NaB3H4 reduction. The structures of the major components of the oligosaccharides were determined by the combination of methylation analysis, acetolysis, and alpha-mannosidase digestion. Based on the results, the whole structures of the major components of (Man)5(GlcNAc)2Asn and (Man)6(GlcNAc)2Asn were elucidated as Manalpha1 leads to 6[Manalpha1 leads to 3]-Manalpha1 leads to 6[Manalpha1 leads to 3[Manbeta1 leads to 4GlcNAcbeta1 leads to 4GlcNAc leads to Asn and Manalpha1 leads to 6[Manalpha1 leads to 3]Manalpha1 leads to 6[Manalpha1 leads to 2Manalpha1 leads to 3]Manbeta1 leads to 4GlcNAcbeta1 leads to GlcNAc leads to Asn, respectively. Since endo-beta-N-acetylglucosamini dase D hydrolyzes (Man)5(GlcNAc)2Asn but not (Man)6(GlcNAc)2Asn, the presence of the unsubstituted alpha-mannosyl residue linked at the C-3 position of the terminal mannose of Manbeta1 leads to 4GlcNAcbeta1 leads to 4 GlcNAcAsn core must be essential for the action of the enzyme."}

The apoprotein of hog kidney D-amino acid oxidase was reconstituted with 5-deazaflavin adenine dinucleotide (5-deazaFAD) to yield a protein which contains 1.5 mol of 5-deazaFAD/mol of enzyme. The deazaFAD-containing enzyme forms complexes with benzoate, 2-amino benzoate, and 4-aminobenzoate which are both qualitatively and quantitatively similar to those observed with native enzyme. The complex with 2-aminobenzoate exhibits a new long wavelength absorption band characteristic of a flavin charge-transfer complex. The reconstituted enzyme exhibits no activity when assayed by D-alanine oxidation. However, the bound chromophore can be reduced by alanine, phenylalanine, proline, methionine, and valine, but not by glutamate or aspartate, indicating the deazaFAD enzyme retains the substrate specificity of the native enzyme. Reduction of the enzyme by D-alanine exhibits a 1.6-fold deuterium isotope effect. Reoxidation of the reduced enzyme occurred in the presence of pyruvate plus ammonia, but not with pyruvate alone or ammonia alone. beta-Phenylpyruvate and alpha-ketobutyrate, but not alpha-ketoglutarate could replace pyruvate. Reduced enzyme isolated following reaction with [alpha-3H]alanine was found to contain 0.5 mol of tritium/mol of deazaFADH2. After denaturation of the tritium-labeled enzyme, the radioactivity was identified as deazaFADH2. Reaction of the reduced tritium-labeled enzyme with pyruvate plus ammonia prior to denaturation yields [alpha-3H]alanine and unlabeled deazaFAD. These results suggest that reduction and reoxidation of enzyme-bound deazaFAD involves the stereo-specific transfer of alpha-hydrogen from substrate to deazaFAD."}
{"_id": "391", "description": "The NSILA-s receptor in liver plasma membranes. Characterization and comparison with the insulin receptor.. NSILA-s (nonsuppressible insulin-like activity, soluble in acid ethanol) is a serum peptide that has insulin-like and growth-promoting activities. We have demonstrated previously that liver plasma membranes possess separate receptors for NSILA-s and insulin and have characterized the insulin receptor in detail. In the present study we have characterized the properties and specificity of the NSILA-s receptor and compared them to those of the insulin receptor in the same tissue. Both 125I-NSILA-s and 125I-insulin bind rapidly and reversibly to their receptors in liver membranes; maximal NSILA-s binding occurs at 20 degrees while maximal insulin binding is seen at 1-4 degrees. The pH optimum for NSILA-s binding is broad (6.0 to 8.0), in contrast to the very sharp pH optimum (7.5 to 8.0) for insulin binding. Both receptors exhibit a high degree of specificity. With the insulin receptor, NSILA-s and insulin analogues compete for binding in proportion to their insulin-like potency: insulin greater than proinsulin greater than NSILA-s. With the NSILA-s receptor, NSILA-s is most potent and the order is reversed: NSILA-s greater than proinsulin greater than insulin. Furthermore, six preparations of NSILA-s which varied 70-fold in biological activity competed for 125I-NSILA-s binding in order of their potencies. NSILA-s which had been inactivated biologically by reduction and aminoethylation and growth hormone were less than 1/100,000 as potent as the most purified NSILA-s preparation. Purified preparations of fibroblast growth factor, epidermal growth factor, nerve growth factor, and somatomedins B and C were less than 1% as effective as NSILA-s in competing for the 125I-NSILA-s suggesting that these factors act through other receptors. In contrast, somatomedin A was 10% as active as NSILA-s and multiplication-stimulating activity was fully as active as NSILA-s in competing for the NSILA-s receptor. Analysis of the data suggests that there are approximately 50 times more insulin receptors than NSILA-s receptors per liver cell, while the apparent affinity of NSILA-s receptors is somewhat higher than that of the insulin receptor."}
{"_id": "392", "description": "Decarboxylation of oxalacetate to pyruvate by purified avian liver phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase.. Phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase, which has been isolated from chicken liver mitochondria in essentially homogenous form, carries out the irreversible decarboxylation of oxalacetate to pyruvate in the presence of catalytic amounts of GDP or IDP, as well as the reversible decarboxylation of oxalacetate to phosphoenolpyruvate in the presence of substrate amounts of GTP or ITP. The pyruvate- and phosphoenolpyruvate-forming reactions are similar in their nucleoside specificity and appear to be carried out by the same protein. However, the two activities vary markedly in their response to added metal ions and sulfhydryl reagents. Phosphoenolpyruvate formation is completely dependent on the presence of a divalent metal ion, with Mn2+ the most effective species. This reaction is also stimulated by sulfhydryl reagents such as 2-mercaptoethanol. In contrast, the pyruvate-forming reaction is strongly inhibited by divalent metal ions, including Mn2+, and also by moderate concentrations of sulfhydryl reagents. These observations and the demonstration that pyruvate kinase-like activity is very low or absent make it unlikely that pyruvate formation proceeds via phosphoenolpyruvate as an intermediate. Although the pyruvate-forming reaction is inhibited by added metal ions, the reaction is also inhibited by metal-chelating agents such as 8-hydroxyquinoline and o-phenanthroline, suggesting that the reaction is dependent on the presence of a metal ion. It has not been possible, however, to demonstrate that the enzyme is a metalloprotein."}
{"_id": "393", "description": "Hemoglobin Deer Lodge (beta 2 His replaced by Arg). Consequences of altering the 2,3-diphosphoglycerate binding site.. Hemoglobin Deer Lodge is an abnormal human hemoglobin with arginine substituted for histidine at the beta 2 position. X-ray crystallography of normal human hemoglobin has shown that the beta 2 residue is normally part of the binding site for 2,3-diphosphoglycerate. The substitution of arginine for histidine at beta 2 affects both the kinetics and equilibria of ligand binding. When stripped of anions, Hb Deer Lodge has an increased oxygen affinity and a decreased degree of cooperativity relative to Hb A. The alkaline Bohr effect is slightly increased and there are marked increases in oxygen affinity below pH 6 and above pH 8. In the presence of 2,3-diphosphoglycerate the cooperativity in increases to nromal and the pH dependence of oxygen binding is reduced. This contrasts with the enhanced Bohr effect seen for Hb A in the presence of organic phosphates. Due to enhanced anion binding at high pH, Hb Deer Lodge has a slightly lower oxygen affinity than Hb A at pH 9 in the presence of 2,3-diphosphoglycerate or inositol hexaphosphate. Kinetic studies at neutral pH in the absence of organic phosphates revealed biphasicity in the rate of oxygen dissociation from Hb Deer Lodge, while approximately linear time courses were observed for Hb A. The fast phase of the oxygen dissociation kinetics shows great pH sensitivity, and organic phosphates increase the rate and percentage of the fast phase without greatly affecting the slow phase. The two phases are not resolvable at high pH. CO combination kinetics are much like those of Hb A except that \"fast\" and \"slow\" phases were apparent at wavelengths near the deoxy-CO isobestic point. We suggest that functional differences between the alpha and beta chains are enhanced in Hb Deer Lodge. After flash photolysis of the CO derivative, the percentage of quickly reacting material was slightly greater for Hb Deer Lodge than for Hb A. This may imply a somewhat greater tendency to dissociate into high affinity subunits. The substitution of arginine for histidine at beta 2 thus results in a macromolecule whose ligand-binding properties are significantly altered, the primary differences being expressed at high pH where Hb Deer Lodge binds anions more strongly than Hb A. The properties of Hb Deer Lodge are compared to those of other hemoglobin variants with substitutions at residues involved in binding of 2,3-diphosphoglycerate."}
{"_id": "394", "description": "Patterns of fatty acid release from endogenous substrates by human platelet homogenates and membranes.. We describe a method for measuring the release of fatty acids from endogenous substrates of human platelet homogenates and membranes. The method depends on the availability of lipids whose fatty acids are odd-chained and therefore suitable as internal reference compounds that, at the time of lipid extraction, can be added to an incubation to permit subsequent quantification of the content of free fatty acids or fatty acids esterified to specific lipids. We found four types of lipolytic activities in human platelets. In homogenates at pH 4.0 a triglyceride lipase operated as shown by the synchrony of triglyceride degradation and release of glycerol and those fatty acids that are the predominant constituents of triglycerides. However, enough arachidonic acid was released at this pH level to suggest some phospholipid breakdown, since triglycerides hold relatively small amounts of this acid. With membranous preparations, in the alkaline pH range there were two peaks of fatty acid release with accompanying degradation of phospholipids. At pH 8.5, where release of the saturated acids, palmitic and stearic, predominated, their sum was 3.5 times that of arachidonic acid. At pH 9.5 the release of palmitic and stearic acids was only slightly below their peak values; however, the release of arachidonic acid nearly equaled the sum of the saturated acids. Linoleic acid was not released in representative amounts by those reactions that released arachidonic acid, despite the overwhelming propensity of both to be esterified at the 2-position of phospholipids. Pertinently, the choline phospholipids are linoleic-rich and the non-choline phospholipids linoleic-poor, while both have a generous endowment of arachidonic acid. With this in mind, we raise the possibility that the phospholipase A2 of human platelets is an endoenzyme because of its tendency to act on those phospholipids that are thought to comprise the inner layer of the cell membrane."}

Treatment of submitochondrial particles (ETP) with trypsin at 0 degrees destroyed NADPH leads to NAD (or 3-acetylpyridine adenine dinucleotide, AcPyAD) transhydrogenase activity. NADH oxidase activity was unaffected; NADPH oxidase and NADH leads to AcPyAD transhydrogenase activities were diminished by less than 10%. When ETP was incubated with trypsin at 30 degrees, NADPH leads to NAD transhydrogenase activity was rapidly lost, NADPH oxidase activity was slowly destroyed, but NADH oxidase activity remained intact. The reduction pattern by NADPH, NADPH + NAD, and NADH of chromophores absorbing at 475 minus 510 nm (flavin and iron-sulfur centers) in complex I (NADH-ubiquinone reductase) or ETP treated with trypsin at 0 degrees also indicated specific destruction of transhydrogenase activity. The sensitivity of the NADPH leads to NAD transhydrogenase reaction to trypsin suggested the involvement of susceptible arginyl residues in the enzyme. Arginyl residues are considered to be positively charged binding sites for anionic substrates and ligands in many enzymes. Treatment of ETP with the specific arginine-binding reagent, butanedione, inhibited transhydrogenation from NADPH leads to NAD (or AcPyAD). It had no effect on NADH oxidation, and inhibited NADPH oxidation and NADH leads to AcPyAD transhydrogenation by only 10 to 15% even after 30 to 60 min incubation of ETP with butanedione. The inhibition of NADPH leads to NAD transhydrogenation was diminished considerably when butanedione was added to ETP in the presence of NAD or NADP. When both NAD and NADP were present, the butanedione effect was completely abolished, thus suggesting the possible presence of arginyl residues at the nucleotide binding site of the NADPH leads to NAD transhydrogenase enzyme. Under conditions that transhydrogenation from NADPH to NAD was completely inhibited by trypsin or butanedione, NADPH oxidation rate was larger than or equal to 220 nmol min-1 mg-1 ETP protein at pH 6.0 and 30 degrees. The above results establish that in the respiratory chain of beef-heart mitochondria NADH oxidation, NADPH oxidation, and NADPH leads to NAD transhydrogenation are independent reactions."}

By the use of insolubilized acid deoxyribonuclease, eight other proteins interacting with the enzyme have been detected. One of them (molecular weight, 59,000) was identified as responsible for phosphodiesterase activity which is often a contaminant of DNase preparations. Acid DNase (free of phosphodiesterase) and its inhibitor have been obtained as homogeneous proteins, as determined by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The molecular weight of acid DNase and its inhibitor are, respectively, 26,500 and 21,500; those of other proteins range from 17,000 to 112,000. The properties of beef liver acid DNase are similar to those described for the enzymes extracted from other sources. The same alteration of DNase kinetics by this inhibitor, as that previously demonstrated with an impure protein has been confirmed; the sigmoidal shape observed at pH 5 for the plot of initial rate versus substrate concentration progressively disappears with increasing pH. We have also demonstrated that RNA, which inhibits the acid DNase through a competitive binding to the catalytic site, is able, like the substrate, to reverse the binding of inhibitor to the enzyme."}

Besides dynein, which can be solubulized from Chlamydomonas flagella as a heterogeneous, Mg2+ or Ca2+-activated ATPase, we have purified and characterized five other flagellar enzymes involved in nucleotide transformations. A homogeneous, low molecular weight, Ca2+-specific adenosine triphosphatase was isolated, which was inhibited by Mg2+ and was not specific for ATP. This enzyme was not formed by treating purified dynein with proteases. It was absent from extracts of Tetrahymena cilia. Its function might be an auxiliary energy transducer, or in steering or tactic responses. Two species of adenylate kinase were isolated, one of which was much elevated in regenerating flagella; the latter was also present in cell bodies. A large part of flagellar nucleoside diphosphokinase activity could not be solubilized. Two soluble enzyme species were identified, one of which was also present in cell bodies. Since these enzymes are of interest because they might function in microtubule assembly, we studied the extent to which brain nucleoside diphosphokinase co-polymerizes with tubulin purified by repeated cycles of polymerization.

The enzyme reaction shows a pH optimum of 6.3 and requires detergents. Both Mn2+ and Ca2+ inhibited the reaction, whereas Mg2+ had no effect. The apparent Km for galactocerebroside leading to G7 was estimated to be 8.7 X 10(-4) M. The same microsomal preparation also synthesized hematoside when ceramide lactoside was the glycolipid acceptor. The apparent Km for ceramide lactoside was about one-tenth that for galactocerebroside. When the preparations were partially inactivated by heat the synthesis of G7 and of hematoside was reduced at approximately the same rate. Liver appeared to have the highest activity for G7 synthesis (as well as of hematoside), followed by brain. The synthesis of B7 by mouse brain microsomes in vitro demonstrates a new pathway for brain ganglioside synthesis."}

A partially resolved protein mixture left over after one of the steps in that procedure was passed through a Sephadex G-75 column. By this means, a component with carboxypeptidase activity was separated from associated serine endopeptidases. Further purification of this exopeptidase to apparent homogeneity was acheived by refiltration through the same Sephadex column and by CM-cellulose chromatography. A single protein band was observed after acrylamide gel electrophoresis; analysis by sedimentation equilibrium using the meniscus depletion method gave a molecular weight of 30,300. This enzyme demonstrates activity against Nalpha-benzyloxycarbonylglycyl-L-leucine and hippuryl-D,L-phenyllactate; no activity was found against Nalpha-acetyl-L-tyrosine ethyl ester, Nalpha-benzoyl-D,L-arginine-p-nitroanilide, or L-leuckne-p-nitroanilide. The maximum activity lies between pH values of 7 and 8; the enzyme is stable between pH values of 6 and 10. At room temperature 1,10-phenanthroline inactivates the enzyme completely whereas EDTA has no effect. Of the many cations tested, only Co2+, Ni2+, or Zn2+ restores activity to the 1,10-phenanthroline-treated enzyme; Co2+ provided 3 times the native activity. The metal in the native protein was found to be zinc. These findings are similar to those recorded with bovine pancreatic carboxypeptidase A, and suggest the possibility that the present enzyme may ge genetically related to the mammalian protein, as in previously noted examples of homology of three Pronase endopeptidases to pancreatic serine enzymes."}

Digestion of intact membrane vesicles with soluble trypsin inactivates the water-splitting system, the 3-(3,4-dichlorophenyl)-1,1-dimethylurea inhibition site of Photosystem II, the electron transport between the two photosystems as well as the ferredoxin NADP reductase. Reduction of NADP with artificial electron donors for Photosystem I could be restored, however, by addition of purified reductase to trypsin-digested membranes. Electron transfer activities of Photosystems I and II reaction centers were resistant to trypsin digestion either from outside or from within the thylakoids when active trypsin was trapped inside the membrane vesicles by sonication and digestion carried out in the presence of trypsin inhibitor added from outside. In the latter case, the water-splitting system was also found to be resistant to digestion. Polyacrylamide-bound insolubilized trypsin inactivated only the ferredoxin NADP reductase.

Cytochrome c1 and cytochrome c formed a 1:1 molecular complex in aqueous solutions of low ionic strength. The complex was stable to Sephadex G-75 chromatography. The formation and stability of the complex were independent of the oxidation state of the cytochrome components as far as those reactions studied were concerned. The complex was dissociated in solutions of ionic strength higher than 0.07 or pH exceeding 10 and only partially dissociated in 8 M urea. No complexation occurred when cytochrome c was acetylated on 64% of its lysine residues or photooxidized on its 2 methionine residues. Complexes with molecular ratios of less than 1:1 (i.e. more cytochrome c) were obtained when polymerized cytochrome c, or cytochrome c with all lysine residues guanidinated, or a \"1-65 heme peptide\" from cyanogen bromide cleavage of cytochrome c was used. These results were interpreted to imply that the complex was predominantly maintained by ionic interactions probably involving some of the lysine residues of cytochrome c but with major stabilization dependent on the native conformations of both cytochromes. The reduced complex was autooxidizable with biphasic kinetics with first order rate constants of 6 X 10(-5) and 5 X U0(-5) s-1 but did not react with carbon monoxide. The complex reacted with cyanide and was reduced by ascorbate at about 32% and 40% respectively, of the rates of reaction with cytochrome c alone. The complex was less photoreducible than cytochrome c1 alone. The complex exhibited remarkably different circular dichroic behavior from that of the summation of cytochrome c1 plus cytochrome c. We concluded that when cytochromes c1 and c interacted they underwent dramatic conformational changes resulting in weakening of their heme crevices.

Incubation of leucine aminopeptidase (bovine lens) (EC 3.4.1.1) with various concentrations of Mg2+ at various pH values in 1 M KCl and 0.155 M trimethylamine-HCl at 37 degrees confirms that Mg2+ competes with Zn2+ for binding only 1 site per 54,000-dalton subunit. The ratio of the apparent association constants (1KZn:1KMg = 1KZn/Mg) at this site (site 1) was estimated to be 20,720 at pH 8.16, 10,570 at pH 8.44, 3,590 at pH 8.78, and 660 AT PH 9.14. The decrease in values of 1KZn/Mg with increasing pH in the activation of leucine aminopeptidase by Mg2+ is attributed to the lowering of the free Zn2+ concentration relative to that of free Mg2+ caused by the formation of ZnOH+ and Zn(OH)2 complexes with increasing OH- concentration. When corrections are made for the binding of Zn2+ by OH- ions, the pH-independent ratio of association constants (1KZn:1KMg = 1KZn/Mg) for the relative binding of Zn2+ and Mg2+ at site 1 of leucine aminopeptidase in 29,800. From the effect of pH on the relative binding constant, a value (beta2) for the product of the two stepwise association constants for the formation of Zn(OH)2 from Zn2+ and OH- (Zn2+ + OH- in equilibrium ZnOH+; ZnOH+ + OH- in equilibrium Zn(OH)2) was estimated to be 4.42 X 10(10) M-2 at 37 degrees. Values of Km at pH 7.5 AND 30 degrees with L-leucine p-nitroanilide as substrate in the presence of 0.01 M NaHCO3 are 4.13 and 2.01 mM for the zinc-zinc and magnesium-zinc enzymes, respectively.

Large numbers of taste buds are distributed over the body surface of the channel catfish ictalurus punctatus, with the barbels having an especially high density. L-Alanine, as well as certain other amino acids, are taste stimuli in this animal. Epithelial tissue obtained by gentle scraping of the barbel surface was fractionated by differential centrifugation. A sedimentable fraction (P2) was prepared that was enriched in L[OH]alanine binding activity, the plasma membrane marker enzyme 5'-nucleotidase, and the mitochondrial marker succinate cytochrome c reductase, but not the microsomal marker NADH cytochrome c redu.ctase. Binding of L-[OH]alanine was measured using a Millipore filter method in which correction for non-specific binding was also determined. Time, temperature, and pH for measuring binding activity were established. At the optimal pH of 7.8, the KD for L-alanine is 4.8 X 10(-6) M. The first order dissociation rate constant at 6 degrees is 3.8 X 10(-4) s-1 and at 24 degrees it is 12.1 X 10(-4) s-1. The second order rate constant for association is between 10(2) and 10(3) M-1 S-1. Reversibility of the binding interaction was also demonstrates by the rapid displacement of bound L-[3H]alanine by a large excess of unlabeled L-alanine. That the binding does not represent incorporation into protein was confirmed by the lack of effect of puromycin. The amounts bound of several other chemostimulatory amino acids werealso determined."}
{"_id": "406", "description": "Structure, composition, physical properties, and turnover of proliferated peroxisomes. A study of the trophic effects of Su-13437 on rat liver.. Peroxisome proliferation has been induced with 2-methyl-2-(p-[1,2,3,4-tetrahydro-1-naphthyl]-phenoxy)-propionic acid (Su-13437). DNA, protein, cytochrome oxidase, glucose-6-phosphatase, and acid phosphatase concentrations remain almost constant. Peroxisomal enzyme activities change to approximately 165%, 50%, 30%, and 0% of the controls for catalase, urate oxidase, L-alpha-hydroxy acid oxidase, and D-amino acid oxidase, respectively. For catalase the change results from a decrease in particle-bound activity and a fivefold increase in soluble activity. The average diameter of peroxisome sections is 0.58 +/- 0.15 mum in controls and 0.73 +/- 0.25 mum after treatment. Therefore, the measured peroxisomal enzymes are highly diluted in proliferated particles. After tissue fractionation, approximately one-half of the normal peroxisomes and all proliferated peroxisomes show matric extraction with ghost formation, but no change in size. In homogenates submitted to mechanical stress, proliferated peroxisomes do not reveal increased fragility; unexpectedly, Su-13437 stabilizes lysosomes. Our results suggest that matrix extraction and increased soluble enzyme activities result from transmembrane passage of peroxisomal proteins. The changes in concentration of peroxisomal oxidases and soluble catalase after Su-13437 allow the calculation of their half-lives. These are the same as those found for total catalase, in normal and treated rats, after allyl isopropyl acetamide: about 1.3 days, a result compatible with peroxisome degradation by autophagy. A sequential increase in liver RNA concentration, [14C]leucine incorporation into DOC-soluble proteins and into immunoprecipitable catalase, and an increase in liver size and peroxisomal volume per gram liver, characterize the trophic effect of the drug used. In males, Su-13437 is more active than CPIB, another peroxisome proliferation-inducing drug; in females, only Su-13437 is active."}

{"_id": "408", "description": "Defective lysosomal enzyme secretion in kidneys of Chediak-Higashi (beige) mice.. The beige mouse is an animal model for the human Chediak-Higashi syndrome, a disease characterized by giant lysosomes in most cell types. In mice, treatment with androgenic hormones causes a 20-50-fold elevation in at least one kidney lysosomal enzyme, beta-glucuronidase. Beige mice treated with androgen had significantly higher kidney beta-glucuronidase, beta-galactosidase, and N-acetyl-beta-D-glucosaminidase (hexosaminidase) levels than normal mice. Other androgen-inducible enzymes and enzyme markers for the cytosol, mitochondria, and peroxisomes were not increased in kidney of beige mice. No significant lysosomal enzyme elevation was observed in five other organs of beige mice with or without androgen treatment, nor in kidneys of beige females not treated with androgen. Histochemical staining for glucuronidase together with subcellular fractionation showed that the higher glucuronidase content of beige mouse kidney is caused by a striking accumulation of giant glucuronidase-containing lysosomes in tubule cells near the corticomedullary boundary. In normal mice lysosomal enzymes are coordinately released into the lumen of the kidney tubules and appreciable amounts of lysosomal enzymes are present in the urine. Levels of urinary lysosomal enzymes are much lower in beige mice than in normal mice. It appears that lysosomes may accumulate in beige mice because of defective exocytosis resulting either from decreased intracellular motility of lysosomes or from their improper fusion with the plasma membrane. A similar defect could account for characteristics of the Chediak-Higashi syndrome."}

The ultrastructural localization of NADH oxidase, a possible enzyme in the increased oxidative activity of polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMN) during phagocytosis, was studied. A new cytochemical technique for the localization of H2O2, a product of NADH oxidase activity, was developed. Cerous ions, in the presence of peroxide, form an electron-dense precipitate. Resting and phagocytically stimulated PMN were exposed to cerous ions at pH 7.5 to demonstrate sites of NADH-dependent, cyanide-insensitive H2O2 production. Resting PMN exhibites slight activity on the plasma membrane; phagocytizing PMN had extensive deposits of reaction product localized within the phagosome and on the plasma membrane. Peroxide involvement was demonstrated by the inhibitory effect of catalase on cerium precipitation; the surface localization of the enzyme responsible was confirmed by using nonpenetrating inhibitors of enzymatic activity. A correlative study was performed with an NADH-dependent, tetrazolium-reduction system. As with cerium, formazan deposition on the surface of the cell was NADH dependent, cyanide insensitive, and stimulated by phagocytosis. Superoxide dismutase did not inhibit tetrazolium reduction, as observed cytochemically, indicating direct enzymatic dye reduction without superoxide interposition. These findings, combined with oxygen consumption studies on resting and stimulated PMN in the presence or absence of NADH, indicate that NADH oxidase is a surface enzyme in human PMN. It is internalized during phagocytosis and retains its peroxide-generating capacity within the phagocytic vacuole."}

Catecholamines produce mitotic inhibition in primary cell cultures of human keratinocytes probably via a block in the G2 part of the cell cycle. Epinephrine produced significant mitotic inhibition (49%) at a concentration as low as 4.5 X 10(-10) M, while its analog, isoproterenol, produced 47% inhibition at 1 X 10(-10) M. Norepinephrine elicited a 49% inhibitory response at 1 X 10(-8) M. One other catecholamine, dopamine, caused a 53% decrease in mitosis at 1 X 10(-6) M. Other structurally related amines to exhibit mitotic inhibition were phenylephrine, 58% at 1 X 10(-7) M; octopamine, 47% at 1 X 10(-5) M; and tyramine, 52% at 1 X 10(-4) M. Serotonin showed no mitotic inhibition at 1 X 10(-4) M. Various alpha and beta adrenergic blocking agents were added to the cell system. The alpha blocking agent, phentolamine, had no effect on mitosis. When added in conjunction with epinephrine or norepinephrine, no reduction of the catecholamine-induced mitotic inhibition was observed. The beta blocking agent, propranolol, by itself showed slight mitotic inhibition at 1 X 10(-6) M. When added along with epinephrine or noreinephrine, propranolol reduced the catecholamine-induced mitotic inhibition approximately 65%. In addition, propranolol blocked mitotic inhibition caused by phenylephrine, an alpha adrenergic agent. However, another beta blocking agent, dichloroisoproterenol, showed strong mitotic inhibition (53%) when added to the cultures at a concentration of 1 X 10(-8) M. The effect was reduced to zero in the presence of propranolol. These data suggest that while beta receptors may be involved in the catecholamine-induced mitotic inhibition of human keratinocytes in vitro, the nature of the receptor-molecule interaction may be complex."}

{"_id": "412", "description": "Stimulation of lactic acid production in chick embryo fibroblasts by serum and high pH in the absence of external glucose.. Lactic acid production by chick embryo fibroblasts occurs in the absence of exogenous glucose. Fifteen to 50-fold less lactic acid is formed in the absence of glucose than in its presence. Nevertheless, serum and pH stimulation enhances this residual lactic acid production to the same relative extent as when glucose is present. The amount of lactic acid formed cannot be accounted for by the catabolism of residual glucose in the medium since its concentration is less than one-tenth that of the lactic acid eventually produced. Moreover, the residual glucose concentration remains constant or increases during the course of the experiment. To a large extent lactic acid accumulation in the absence of external glucose is dependent on the presence of amino acids in the medium, but amino acid transport is not affected by the stimulatory agents used in this study. The results suggest that treatments which stimulate cell multiplication also activate those enzymatic pathways which convert amino acids to pyruvic and thence to lactic acid."}

Granules were isolated from the cytoplasm of the amebocytes of Limulus polyphemus, the horseshoe crab, by disruption of cells obtained from blood which had been drawn into 2 mM propranolol. The granules subsequently were purified by centrifugation through a sucrose gradient that contained heparin. Extracts of the granules were prepared by freezing and thawing the granule preparations in distilled water. Transmission and scanning electron microscopy of the granules revealed round or ovoid particles. However, only one type of granule appeared to be present. The ultraviolet spectrum of the extract of amebocyte granules demonstrated a peak at 277 nm at pH 7.4, and a shift into two peaks of 281 nm and 290 nm at alkaline pH. Analytical ultracentrifugation revealed a pattern similar to that observed with lysates prepared from intact amebocytes. Polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, in the presence of urea at pH 4.5, demonstrated patterns similar to those observed with amebocyte lysate. Extracts of the granules were gelled by bacterial endotoxin. The blood of the horseshoe crab contains only one type of cell, the amebocyte. Previous studies have shown that the blood coagulation mechanism of Limulus is contained entirely within amebocytes. The current studies suggest that the granules, which pack the cytoplasm of these cells, contain all of the factors required for the coagulation of blood, including the clottable protein. The intracellularly localized coagulation system is released from amebocytes when their granules rupture during cell aggregation."}

The dose dependence of the acute effects of ethanol upon liver intermediary metabolism in vivo has been demonstrated in rats. Ethanol was given i.p. in doses of 0.69, 1.7, and 3.0 g/kg in equal volumes (20 ml/kg). The liver was freeze-clamped 120 min after injection, and multiple metabolites were measured in the perchloric acid extract of the tissue. Each group showed a significantly different pattern of metabolites, redox states, and phosphorylation potentials although the rate of ethanol disappearance, at least between the two highest dose groups, was not significantly different. The mitochondrial free [NAD+]/[NADH] ratios and the cytoplasmic free [NADP+]/[NADPH] ratio were paradoxically most reduced with the lowest dose of ethanol and became progressively more oxidized with increasing dose. Once established, the differences in these ratios between the groups tended to persist with time, relatively independent of the concentration of ethanol. In a somewhat different pattern, the phosphorylation potential ([ATP]/[ADP][P1]) remained at the control level in the low-dose group but was significantly elevated in the two higher-dose groups. The results, therefore, show distinct and complicated dose-dependent patterns of intermediary metabolism that cannot be explained completely by any one hypothesis but that imply significant dose-dependent effects of ethanol upon intermediary metabolism not directly related to NADH production."}
{"_id": "423", "description": "Factors affecting the solubility of calcium pyrophosphate dihydrate crystals.. The solubility of triclinic calcium pyrophosphate dihydrate (CPPD) crystals was measured under varying conditions using 45Ca-labeled crystals, expressing solubility as micromoles per liter of 45Ca in solution. In a 0.1-M Tris-HC1 buffer pH 7.4, the solubility of accurately sized CPPD crystals (37-20mum) was 60muM with maximal solubility being attained after about 8 h incubation at 37degreeC. Reduction in crystal size, decrease in pH, increase in ionic strength, Mg++, citrate, and albumin all increased solubility. The most marked effects on solubility occurred when changing the calcium concentration or by enzymatic hydrolysis of inoganic pyrophosphate to orthophosphate. It was found that decreasing the ionized calcium level below 5 mg/100 ml resulted in a progressive enhancement of solubility. The observed solubility-enhancing effects of albumin could be explained solely on its calcium-binding ability and thereby, altered ionized calcium level. Diffusible calcium in synovial fluid was only 40% of the total calcium concentration, which means most joint fluids are normally near the critical concentration of 5 mg/100 ml of ionized calcium, below which solubility is enhanced. During surgery, especially parathyroidectomy, calcium levels fall, favoring dissolution of CPPD crystals. We speculate that the slight decrease in crystal size during dissolution frees them from their cartilaginous mold, resulting in a dose-dependent inflammatory reaction as they are \"shed\" into the joint space. Crystal shedding may be reinforced by the modest fall in joint fluid pH accompanying the inflammatory response."}

Using the \"hot plate\" analgesia assessment situation with rats, this conditioning view of tolerance is supported by several findings: (a) It is necessary to have reliable environmental cues predicting the systemic effects of morphine if tolerance is to be observed, (b) a hyperalgesic conditioned response may be observed in morphine-tolerant subjects when drug administration cues are followed by a placebo, and (c) merely by repeatedly presenting environmental cues previously associated with morphine (but now presented with a placebo), morphine tolerance can be extinguished."}

The absorbance at 509 nm is independent of calcium ion concentration and, therefore, could be used to measure the total dye. The spectra are pH dependent but constant in the range 6.5 to 7.0. The apparent dissociation constant of calcium murexide is dependent upon ionic environment, ionic strength, and free calcium ion concentration. The relationship between the apparent dissociation constant and free calcium concentration was established. Whole casein had no effect on the absorption spectra of calcium murexide and no affinity for calcium murexide complex or murexide ion. Beta-casein, at the concentrations employed, did not influence the dissociation fo calcium murexide.

The relationship of enzymatic activity to organelle development and organelle number during differentiation of the metanephric kidney in the mouse was approached from several experimental directions. Biochemical analyses of marker enzymes for peroxisomes (catalase and D-amino acid oxidase), mitochondria (cytochrome oxidase) and lysosomes (acid phosphatase) were performed on kidneys at ages from 17 days prenatal to adult. These data were correlated with a morphometric analysis of populations of peroxisomes and mitochondria in differentiating cells of the proximal tubule. Postnatal development of the metanephric kidney was found to be accompanied by a rapid increase in both the specific activity of catalase and the number of peroxisomes per 100 mu2 in the proximal tubule during the first 4 weeks of postnatal growth. Elaboration of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) was seen to parallel the increase in number of peroxisomes to which segments of ER were often in close apposition. Extensive interactions between segments of ER and peroxisomes were readily visible in 0.5-mu sections viewed in the high voltage electron microscope. In contrast to peroxisomes, neither mitochondria nor lysosomes followed a similar pattern of net organelle increase, suggesting that a defined population density of mitochondria and lysosomes may exist in the proximal tubule at birth, prior to complete development of the kidney."}

Such bone marrow reactions were also induced with histamine or serotonin and peaked 1 hr after administration. The histamine-induced changes were inhibited by prior treatment with diphenhydramine. These reactions were also produced by injection of a small amount of both histamine and serotonin, whereas no change was found when mice were given a single injection of a larger dose of histamine or serotonin. These results indicate that histamine and serotonin released in mice at the initial stage after endotoxin synergistically trigger the bone marrow reactions, which then continue in the presence of further mediators. Antihistamines and antiserotonins are considered to hinder the whole process of reactions produced by endotoxin."}

When plasma proteins are diluted with buffer the ionic strength and ionic composition of that buffer affects the interactions between thyroxine (T4) and its plasma protein-binding sites. Increases in phosphate, chloride or barbiturate ion concentration from 50 to 200 mmol/l caused a significant decrease in the affinity of plasma proteins for T4, and a concurrent increase in the concentration of unbound T4. These results cannot be completely accounted for by changes in ionic strength since at the same ionic strength different anions caused quantitatively different effects on unbound T4 concentration. The degree of depression of T4 binding by the three anions studied was in the order barbiturate greater than chloride greater than phosphate. The results of a systematic study on the composition of diluent buffer systems indicated that when a 50 mM-sodium phosphate-100 mM-NaCl buffer (pH 7-4) was used as a plasma diluent, there were unlikely to be gross changes in the T4-binding properties of plasma proteins with dilution."}
{"_id": "446", "description": "On the interactions between pancreatic lipase and colipase and the substrate, and the importance of bile salts.. The interactions between pancreatic lipase and colipase and the substrate and the effect of bile salts on these interactions have been investigated by the use of kinetic experiments and studies on the semiquantitative phase distribution of lipase and colipase activities. The results suggest that lipase binds to hydrophobic interfaces with partial irreversible inactivation. Bile salts in the range of micellar concentrations and above a pH of about 6.5 displace lipase from this binding, resulting in a reversible in activation. At pH values below about 6.5, lipase binds strongly to the substrate even in the presence of bile salt, and a low activity peak is seen around pH 5.5. This is the result of the binding of lipase to the \"supersubstrate\" and the activity of the catalytic site. In the presence of bile salt, colipase promotes the binding of lipase to the \"supersubstrate\" but not to other hydrophobic interfaces, and catalytic activity is reestablished. Kinetic data indicate that the binding between colipase and lipase in the presence of substrate is strong and occurs in an approximately stoichiometric relationship."}

Using the Falck-Hillarp histochemical technique for monoamines, evidence was found for the presence of a catecholamine in the salivary gland nerves of the moth, Manduca sexta. 2. The innervation was studied with the electron microscope. Only the fluid-secreting region of the gland is innervated and the nerve endings are characteristic of monoamine-containing terminals. 3. Using a sensitive enzymatic-isotopic assay for catecholamines, it was found that whole salivary glands contain 0.33 mug/g dopamine but no noradrenaline. 4. It seems likely that dopamine mediates fluid-secretion in the salivary gland of Manduca as it does a number of other arthropods."}
{"_id": "449", "description": "An electrophysiological analysis of chemoreception in the sea anemone Tealia felina.. 1. Electrophysiological techniques have been employed to examine the nature of the response observed in the ectodermal slow-conduction system (SSI) when dissolved food substances contact the column of Tealia felina. The response seems to consist entirely of sensory activity which may continue for periods of many minutes, provided that the stimulatory chemicals remain contacting the column. 2. The interval between each evoked pulse gradually increases as the sensory response progresses. This does not result from fatigue in the conduction system but involves a genuine process of sensory adaptation. This may occur over a period of several minutes, which is much longer than comparable adaptation in higher animals. 3. Physiological evidence suggests that the chemoreceptors involved are dispersed throughout the column ectoderm and are absent from the pedal disc, oral disc, tentacles and pharynx. 4. The basic role of the SSI in coordinating behavioural activity in sea anemones is reviewed. It is concluded that it functions primarily as a single, diffuse-conducting unit responsible for transmitting frequency-coded sensory information from ectodermal chemoreceptors to ectodermal (and perhaps endodermal) effectors."}
{"_id": "450", "description": "The selective eosinophil chemotactic activity of histamine.. Histamine diphosphate was shown to selectively attract human eosinophils from mixed granulocyte populations when over 20% eosinophils were used in a modified Boyden chamber chemotactic assay system. This effect of histamine is abolished by incubation with diamine oxidase (histaminase) and was generated by decarboxylation of L-histidine. A linear dose dependent increase in eosinophil migration was observed between 3 X 10(-7) M and 1.25 X 10(-6) M, while higher concentrations of histamine inhibited the migration of eosinophils. The attractant activity of histamine was not inhibited by H-1 or H-2 receptor antagonists, however, the inhibition of migration observed at higher histamine concentrations was reversed by metiamine, an H-2 receptor antagonist. The effects of histamine upon eosinophil migration were demonstrable using three different assays: (a) counting cells that had traversed 5-mum pore, 12-mum thick polycarbonate filters, (b) counting cells that had migrated various distances into a 3-mum pore, 145-mum cellulose nitrate filters, or (c) measuring the number of cells that had traversed an upper polycarbonate filter and migrated into a lower cellulose nitrate filter using 15Cr-labeled cells. The ability of histamine to enhance eosinophil migration was shown to be dependent upon the presence of a concentration gradient; histamine did not cause a dose-dependent increase in random motility. Furthermore, preincubation of the eosinophils with histamine deactivate the cells to further stimulation by histamine or by C5a. It is concluded that in low doses histamine is a chemoattractant for human eosinophils, while in higher doses histamine inhibits eosinophil migration. These observations may relate to the influx and localization of eosinophils in immediate hypersensitivity reactions."}

Comparative studies of protein structure and function can be quite interesting by themselves, and even more interesting when interpreted with respect to an animal's physiology. In the case of fish hemoglobins, some success in the latter has been achieved but there are still many unsolved problems. It appears that comparative physiology and biochemistry have entered an era where results from comparative studies can shed a great deal of light on biochemical mechanisms in general. The trout hemoglobin system is an example. Distinctive hemoglobins in this system are presently being used as high resolution probes of the ligand-binding mechanism. Characterization of the multiple, structurally distinct subunits of the 60S Limulus hemocyanin molecule may similarly aid in understanding its function. Our studies suggest the possibility of using Limulus hemocyanin and other hemocyanins as structural homologs and analogs of more complex macromolecular arrays. The rapid development of molecular structural data from X-ray crystallographers combined with the vast data of comparative physiology and biochemistry makes this one of the most exciting areas in present day science."}
{"_id": "452", "description": "How do biological systems discriminate among physically similar ions?. This paper reviews the history of understanding how biological systems can discriminate so strikingly among physically similar ions, especially alkali cations. Appreciation of qualitative regularities (\"permitted sequences\") and quantitative regularities (\"selectivity isotherms\") in ion selectivity grew first from studies of ion exchangers and glass electrodes, then of biological systems such as enzymes and cell membranes, and most recently of lipid bilayers doped with model pores and carriers. Discrimination of ions depends on both electrostatic and steric forces. \"Black-box\" studies on intact biological membranes have in some cases yielded molecular clues to the structure of the actual biological pores and carriers. Major current problems involve the extraction of these molecules; how to do it, what to do when it is achieved, and how (and if) it is relevant to the central problems of membrane function. Further advances are expected soon from studies of rate barriers within membranes, of voltage-dependent (\"excitable\") conducting channels, and of increasingly complex model systems and biological membranes."}

A technique utilizing Pregnant Mare's Serum Gonadotropin and Human Chorionic Gonadotropin treatment of hens (Gallus domesticus), followed by manual ovulation of the excised follicles, was developed to obtain a large number of mature ova. The intact ova were used to test whether acrosin, partially purified from the spermatozoa of the cock (Gallus domesticus), partially purified rabbit testicular acrosin and commercial preparations of several hydrolytic enzymes could dissolve the inner vitelline membrane. Enzymes were applied to pieces of filter paper placed on the ovum. Cock acrosin and endopeptidases such as trypsin, chymotrypsin, collagenase and elastase hydrolyzed the membrane whereas exopeptidases such as leucine aminopeptidase and carboxypeptidase A did not. Phospholipase A, sulfatase, hyaluronidase, beta-glucuronidase and rabbit testicular acrosin also failed to hydrolyze the membrane. Cock acrosin hydrolysis of the ovum surface was inhibited by soybean trypsin inhibitor. The surface of the ovum over the germinal disc region was hydrolyzed more quickly by cock acrosin than the surface over other regions of the ovum. Acrosin from cock sperm caused the release of trichloroacetic acid soluble material absorbing at 280 nm from sonicated preparations of inner vitelline membranes. Hydrolysis was greatest at pH 8.0 and was inhibited by soybean trypsin inhibitor."}
{"_id": "453", "description": "Photoreceptor processes: some problems and perspectives.. Visual photoreceptors from both vertebrates and invertebrates are characterized by extensive elaboration of membrane which contains visual pigment (rhodopsin). Visual pigments in all phyla examined are chemically similar: the chromophore is 11-cis retinaldehyde attached by an aldimine linkage (Schiff base) to a membrane protein, opsin. The effect of light is to isomerize the chromophore to the all-trans configuration. Beyond these fundamental similarities, several specific areas are discussed in which variations and differences appear. (1) Light causes vertebrate visual pigments to bleach, liberating the chromophore. Most invertebrate visual pigments do not bleach in the light, but instead form a thermally stable metarhodopsin, with the chromophore in the all-trans configuration still attached to the opsin. (2) In the disk membranes of vertebrate rod and cone outer segments, the rhodopsin molecules are oriented with their chromophores nearly coplanar with the disks. Within this plane, however, both rotational and translational diffusion are possible. In the microvillar membranes of arthropod and cephalopod rhabdoms, on the other hand, the situation is less clear. There is evidence for some preferential orientation of chromophores that implies restrictions on Brownian rotation. (3) In the outer segments of vertebrate receptors, absorption of light by rhodopsin causes the plasma membrane to hyperpolarize due to a decrease in sodium conductance, possibly mediated by calcium ions. In most invertebrate photoreceptors, light causes a depolarization due to an increase in conductance, principally to sodium ions. A subsequent entry of calcium causes a partial repolarization of the membrane, due to a decrease in sodium conductance. (4) For vertebrate receptors, log threshold is directly proportional to the fraction of rhodopsin bleached (Dowling-Rushton relationship). The proportionality constant varies in different preparations from less than four to more than 30, and the physical basis for the relationship is unknown. For invertebrates, by contrast, the dependence of sensitivity on rhodopsin concentration is much less dramatic and may well depend simply on the probability of quantum catch. (5) In most species, vertebrate and invertebrate, the accumulation of photoproduct probably has no effect on membrane conductance, but several possible exceptions exist. (6) Photoregeneration of rhodopsin from metarhodopsin is likely an important mechanism of recovery in certain arthropods such as diurnal insects, but dark mechanisms of recovery also exist in all phyla. In no single case are they adequately understood."}

In order to test the range of pH values over which the titratable carried model for inorganic anion exchange is valid, chloride self-exchange across human red blood cells was examined between pH 4.75 and 5.7 at 0 decrees c. It was found that chloride self-exchange flux had a minimum near pH 5 and increased again with further increase in hydrogen ion activity. The Arrhenius activation energy for chloride exchange was greatly reduced at low pH values. The chloride flux at pH 5.1 did not show the saturation kinetics reported at higher pH values but was proportional to the value of the chloride concentration squared. In addition, the extent of inhibition of chloride self-exchange flux by phloretin was reduced at low pH. Our interpretation of these findings is that the carrier-mediated flux becomes a progressively smaller fraction of the total flux at lower pH values and that a different transport mode requiring two chloride ions to form the permeant species and having a low specificity and temperature dependence becomes significant below pH5. A possible mechanism for this transport is that chloride crosses red cell membranes as dimers of HCl at these very low pH values."}

When activated, the receptor is permeable to K+ and Na+, but not to Cl- ions. Measurement of Er in Tris+-substituted, Na-free medium also indicated a permeability to Tris+ ions. Unlike adult frog muscle the magnitude of Er was insensitive to change in external Ca++ (up to 30 mM) or to changes in external pH (between 6.4 and 8.9). The equivalent circuit equation describing the electrical circuit composed of two parallel ionic batteries (EK and ENa) and their respective conductances (gK and gNa), which has been generally useful in describing the Er of adult rat and frog muscle, could also be applied to rat myotubes when Er was measured over a wide range of external Na+ concentrations. The equivalent circuit equation could not be applied to myotubes bathed in media of different external K+ concentrations. In this case, the Er was more closely described by the Goldman constant field equation. Under certain circumstances, it is known that the receptor in adult rat and frog muscle can be induced to reversibly shift from behavior described by the equivalent circuit equation to that described by the Goldman equation. Attempts to similarly manipulate the responses of cultured rat myotubes were unsussessful. These trials included a reduction in temperature (15 degress C), partial alpha-bungarotoxin blodkade, and activation of responses with the cholinergic agonist, decamethonium."}

A 3 (diet: control, high fat, or high carbohydrate) X 2 (kill condition: rested or exhausted) X 2 (training: trained or untrained) factorial design was used to estimate main experimental effects as well as identify significant interactions of the variables. Physical training (treadmill running) was associated with a doubling of the activity of skeletal muscle 3-oxoacid CoA transferase, a key enzyme in extrahepatic ketone body utilization. The activity of the rate-limiting enzyme of liver ketone body production, hydroxymethylglutaryl CoA synthetase (HMG CoA synthetase), was not greatly influenced by training or exhuastive exercise indicating that the metabolic control of the ketosis of exercise may more likely be a function of the supply of fatty acids to the liver rather than the activity of HMG CoA synthetase. Feeding a high fat diet, on the other hand, significantly increased the activity of liver HMG CoA synthetase, indicating that the ketosis of fat feeding may be of a different nature than that of exercise. The results of this study indicate that physical training is associated with biochemical adaptations in ketone body metabolism as well as fatty acid oxidation, and that trained individuals are metabolically better endowed to benefit from the ketosis of exercise than untrained individuals."}

The levels of plasma carotenoids were markedly reduced in broiler cockerels infected with Eimeria acervulina or E. tenella. The mechanisms of this depigmentation differed between the two species, being primarily associated with interference of absorption of xanthophyll (carotenoids) from the intestinal lumen with E. acervulina infection and with leakage through the damaged wall of the cecum with E. tenella infection. Chicks reared on an essentially carotenoid-free diet and inoculated with E. acervulina showed no detectable levels of carotenoids in the blood 48 hours after being changed to a diet containing 30 mg of xanthophyll/kg. Conversely, uninoculated chicks and chicks inoculated with E. tenella showed significant and similar increases in plasma levels of carotenoids. Chicks reared on a diet containing xanthophyll and inoculated with E. tenella showed a more rapid decrease in plasma carotenoids than did uninoculated controls when changed to a xanthophyll-free diet. In chicks fed high xanthophyll diets containing chromic oxide, no indication of malabsorption was seen in chicks infected with E. tenella compared with uninoculated controls, whereas chicks inoculated with E. acervulina showed significantly less xanthophyll absorption. Conversely, a marked increase in the xanthophyll : Cr2O3 ratio was observed in the cecal contents of chicks inoculated with E. tenella compared with uninuoculated controls or those inoculated with E. acervulina. Studies of uninoculated chicks pair-fed with chicks inoculated with E. acervulina or E. tenella indicated that the decrease in plasma carotenoids and increases in intestinal pH are not associated with the reduced intake of feed associated with infection.

No persistent alteration was recognized in hepatic oxidation of palmitate, as estimated by in vitro experiments using liver slices obtained from control and ethanol-drinking mice. Enzymic studies indicated that the activities of acetyl COA carboxylase, ATP citrate lyase, malic enzyme, and 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase were increased with ethanol drinking. The increment in hepatic triglycerides accumulated during ethanol ingestion was largely accounted for by palmitoleic, oleic, and linoleic acids. These findings demonstrated an augmentation in hepatic lipogenesis as well as an increased utilization of exogenous fats. Ethanol drinking did not cause any appreciable change in plasma triglyceride level and metabolism of adipose tissue. In summary of the present studies, accelerated lipogenesis and increased utilization of the dietary fats may be possible causal factors in the alcoholic fatty liver of KK-Ay mice."}
{"_id": "479", "description": "Renal response to acid loading in the developing lamb fetus, intact in utero.. Response of the fetal kidney to metabolic acidosis was studied in five fetal lambs, 115-125 days gestation, in order to evaluate the renal contribution to elimination of hydrogen ion during intra-uterine development. Experiments were conducted on healthy unanesthetized fetuses, intact in utero, with catheters implanted at hysterotomy into a fetal femoral artery and vein and into the bladder via the urachus, four or more days prior to the study. A metabolic acidosis was induced by infusion of isotonic lactic acid, 15 m mole/kg, intravenously over a period of 90 minutes. Serial arterial samples were taken and urine collected in fractions before, during and for three hours following the infusion, for measurements of pH, bicarbonate, lactate and electrolytes as well as urine output. During the infusion, urine pH fell from 6.65 to 6.25 and was 6.34 three hours later (Figs. 1 to 4, Tabs. III to IV). Lactic acid infusion caused a prompt increase in urine output from a mean rate of 0.12 to a maximum of 0.28 ml/kg/min at the end of the infusion, returning to control rates three hours later. Lactate excretion increased from 0.05 to a maximum of 4.6 mumole/kg/min at the end of infusion; titratable acid increased from 0.22 to a maximum of 4 muEq/kg/min; the rates of excretion of lactate and titratable acid were still higher than control at the end of three hours. Ammonia excretion increased from 0.21 to a maximum of 0.56 muEq/kg/min three hours after the end of infusion. The acid infusion caused a small but significant fall in excretion of bicarbonate. During the 90 minutes of infusion and over the following three hours, about 800 mumole lactate was excreted while net acid excretion over the same period was no more than half that amount. The diuresis was also accompanied by a net loss of sodium and chloride, the excretion of these ions increasing more than threefold following acid infusion; excretion of potassium decreased to one-third its rate prior to the infusion. During the 90 minutes of infusion, blood pH fell from 7.36 to 7.13, base deficit rose from 3.8 to 16.4 mEq/L and lactate rose from 2.2 to 14.8 mM/L; there was also a small but significant rise in both blood PCO2 and PO2 (Figs. 1 to 2, Tabs. I to II). During the following three hours of recovery, pH rose gradually to 7.29, base deficit and lactate fell to 7.4 mEq/L and 8.7 mM/L respectively. Since renal excretion of net acid and lactate was small, the decrease in blood base deficit and lactate levels during the recovery must therefore be mainly due to equilibration in various fetal compartments as well as placental transfer. These experiments indicate that, in the lamb fetus, intact in utero, the kidney although limited by immaturity of several mechanisms, is capable of responding to an acid load and thus can make a small contribution to fetal homeostasis. The increase in excretion of net acid is accompanied by loss of sodium and chloride in the urine."}
{"_id": "480", "description": "Recognition and significance of maternogenic fetal acidosis during intensive monitoring of labor.. FHR monitoring and microanalysis of fetal blood are mutually complementary procedures, and optimal knowledge of the fetal state is achieved by making use of both, the former for the preliminary screening of all cases at risk and the latter for the purpose of deciding on obstetric management where pathological changes are evident in the FHR. The major difficulty in obtaining a precise value for the fetal acid-base balance lies in the occurence of \"falsely abnormal\" cases, i.e. cases in which the fetal pH falls during labor but the clinical condition at birth is good (APGAR greater than or equal to 7). In our own series the incidence of such cases among fetuses at risk was 11.2% (Tab. I). In the majority of these cases the fetal acidosis is thought to be a result of increased metabolic acidosis in the mother (maternogenic fetal metabolic acidosis). The importance of the maternogenic fetal acidosis during labor lies in the fact that unless it is recognised, rapid extraction of the fetus will appear necessary on clinical grounds, although it is in fact unnecessary, since this form of acidosis has no adverse effect on the fetus. Various parameters have been proposed for the differential diagnosis of the maternogenic fetal acidosis. These include the feto-maternal difference in base deficit (F/M deltaBD), the materno-fetal differences in pHqu 40 (M/F deltapHqu 40) the materno-fetal difference actual pH (M/F actual deltapH), and the materno-fetal difference in base deficit of the extra-cellular fluid (M/F deltaBDHb5). A critical analysis of these parameters has been carried out on the results of microtests performed during a 5 year period (1968-1972) at the First Clinic of Obstetrics and Gynecology of Milan University. The cases comprised 59 regarded as normal (normal course of pregnancy, spontaneous commencement of labor at term, clear amniotic fluid, regular FHR, spontaneous birth, APGAR at 90 sec between 8 and 10, weight at birth greater than 2500 g), and 335 considered to be at risk (maternal disease, presence of meconium stained amniotic fluid and/or abnormal changes in FHR). In all of these cases the FHR was recorded by cardiotokography, and the tracings were interpreted according to HON. Microsamples of blood were taken from both mother and fetus during labor and the following determinations were carried out: actual pH, pHqu 40, Hb concentration, hemoglobin oxygen saturation, base deficit Hb5 (BDHb5). The maternofetal differences were then calculated. The same determinations were carried out on samples of maternal blood and of arterial and venous cord blood taken immediately after delivery.

The apparent solubility of hexamethylmelamine in aqueous solutions suitable for intravenous use was increased by complexation with gentisic acid. Studies were carried out in the pH 0-8 range. Unprotonated hexamethylmelamine did not form complexes with the gentisate ion, while the hexamethylmelammonium ion appeared to form several different complexes with both the gentidate ion and gentisic acid. Two different solid complexes were isolated and characterized. The solubility increases observed at pH 3.5-5.0 are described by mathematical relationships involving the stability constants of some postulated complex species. From these results, sultable formulations for use as parenteral solutions are proposed. The increase in the apparent aqueous solubility of hexamethylmelamine in such formulations may range from five- to 90-fold, depending upon the pH and total gentisateion concentrations."}

The inhibitory effect of dioctyl sodium sulfosuccinate on the proteolytic activity of trypsin was investigate over the pH 6-8 range. The antitryptic activity was determined using two different substrates: casein and N,alpha-benzoyl-DL-arginine-p-nitroanilide hydrochloride. The mechanistic studies revealed the substrate-inhibitor interaction to be the overall major mechanism of inhibition. This interaction was shown to involve substrate depletion, probably involving some primary sites of the natural substrate casein. Some inhibition was also shown to be due to an interaction between the enzyme and the inhibitior molecules. The interactions of the inhibitor with the enzyme and the substrate were irreversible. The possible therapeutic significance of the inhibitory effect of the surfactant is discussed."}

The adsorption of diphenoxylate hydrochloride, a potent antidiarrheal agent, on activated charcoal powder was studied in vitro. Langmuir adsorption isotherms were established at pH 4 and 7, and the maximum adsorption capacity of charcoal for this drug was estimated using these values. Activated charcoal modified the bioavailability of diphenoxylate hydrochloride in vivo. The antipropulsive action of diphenoxylate in the mouse was strongly inhibited in the presence of activated charcoal. A comparative evaluation of charcoal and chromium oxide used as inert, nonabsorbable markers revealed that chromium oxide may be the marker of choic in GI transit studies in laboratory animals since it does not influence the bioavailability of diphenoxylate hydrochloride."}

[14C]amodiaquin accumulation by washed erythrocyte preparations was characterized to permit comparisons with chloroquine accumulation. Erythrocytes infected with Plasmodium berghei CS (chloroquine-susceptible) accumulate amodiaquin by a saturable process that has an apparent dissociation constant for amodiaquin of 7.6 X 10(-8) M and is competitively inhibited by chloroquine, quinine and quinacrine, as is the process of chloroquine accumulation. Within experimental error, the K1 of 8 X 10(-7) M estimated for chloroquine is the same regardless of whether the drug being accumulated is [14C]amodiaquin or [14C]chloroquine. Likewise, the K1 for amodiaquin is the same regardless of which drug is being accumulated. In addition, glucose stimulates and hydrogen ion, cold or interruption of glycolysis inhibits amodiaquin as well as chloroquine accumulation. These findings are evidence that a single process serves to accumulate both drugs. In the absence of substrate, erythrocytes infected with P. berghei CR (chloroquine-resistant) accumulate twice as much amodiaquin as chloroquine, and they accumulate more amodiaquin than do erythrocytes infected with P. berghei CS. These differences occur because P. berghei CR infects polychromatophilic erythrocytes possessing a high-affinity, substrate-independent process of accumulation to which amodiaquin has greater access than chloroquine. In the presence of glucose, amodiaquin accumulation by erythrocytes infected with P. berghei CR, when plotted as a function of amodiaquin concentration in the medium, describes a sigmoid curve."}

Post-mortem brain material from control and Parkinson's disease patients was examined to elucidate further the neurochemistry of this disease and to determine the mechanism of action of L-dopa as a therapeutic agent. The activities of L-aromatic amino acid decarboxylase (dopa D), tyrosine hydroxylase, monoamine oxidase and catechol-O-methyl transferase were examined; in addition the tissue levels of dopa, 3-O-methyldopa, dopamine (DA) and homovanillic acid (HVA) were determined. In the non-dopa-treated Parkinsonian patients, the greatest decreases were detected for striatal DA and dopa D, with homovanillic acid and tyrosine hydroxylase levels showing a lesser change. The activities of monoamine oxidase and catechol-O-methyl transferase in the striatal nuclei were not different from the controls. The putamen was consistently the most severely affected region. Dopa and 3-O-methyldopa were detectable in all brain areas only in those patients treated with L-dopa shortly before death. The mean concentrations of DA in the striatum of these patients were 1) 9 to 15 times higher than those in non-dopa-treated patients, 2) related to the time before death of the last dose of L-dopa and 3) greater in the striatum of patients clinically classified as \"good responders\" as compared to \"poor responders.\" Although L-dopa therapy increased homovanillic acid levels in all brain areas, a preferential increase was observed in the striatum. It was concluded that L-dopa's principal therapeutic effects in Parkinson's disease are consistent with its transformation to DA in the striatum."}
{"_id": "490", "description": "Studies on the mechanism of depletion of striatal dopamine by alpha-methyl-m-tyrosine.. These experiments were designed to study the mechanism of depletion of dopamine (DA) in the striatum produced by alpha-methyl-m-tyrosine (alpha-MMT). alpha-Methyl-m-tyramine (alpha-MMTA), the metabolite of alpha-MMT, appears to be the active DA-depleting agent, since the administration of a decarboxylase inhibitor before alpha-MMT markedly reduced both the formation of alpha-MMTA and the depletion of DA. After injection of alpha-MMT (100 mg/kg i.p.), the striatal concentration of homovanillic acid (HVA) rose by 41% at 1 hour. This is probably due to an increase in DA metabolism, since alpha-MMT markedly enhanced the decline of DA produced by alpha-methyl-p-tyrosine (alpha-MPT). At 2, 3 and 4 hours after alpha-MMT, the concentration of HVA and dihydroxyphenylacetic acid was below control level. The decrease in dihydroxyphenylacetic acid is due partially to a decreased formation of dihydroxyphenylacetic acid from DA. In striatal slices, both alpha-MMT and alpha-MMTA decreased the formation of 3H-H2O and the accumulation of 3H-DA from 1-3,5-3H-tyrosine. Alpha-MMT did not alter the specific activity of 3H-tyrosine or release 3H-DA from the slices, but it did inhibit the activity of tyrosine hydroxylase in striatal homogenates at low concentrations of tyrosine (10 muM). Alpha-MMTA released both newly synthesized and exogenously accumulated 3H-DA from striatal slices. At low concentrations of alpha-MMTA, the percent reduction in 3H-H2O was much greater than the percentage of 3H-DA released into the medium. However, at higher concentrations, the inhibition of 3H-H2O reached a maximum while 3H-DA release kept increasing. These results suggest that both inhibition of tyrosine hydroxylase activity and DA release from storage sites by alpha-MMTA may account for the depletion of DA produced by the injection of alpha-MMT."}
{"_id": "491", "description": "Characteristics of gastric inhibition by acidification of oxyntic gland area.. 1. Gastric acid responses to the test meals were measured in the Heidenhain pouch, gastric and pancreatic fistula dogs, using the intragastric titration method, and monitoring the rate at which a solution of 1-0 N-NaOH had to be added to maintain the pH of the gastric content constant at pre-selected values ranging from 5-0 to 1-0. In this way the pH profile of the gastric acid and pepsin responses to a liver extract meal kept in the Heidenhain pouch or gastric fistula as well as to exogenous stimuli such as histamine, pentagastrin or Urecholine could be determined. 2. A liver extract meal adjusted to pH 5-0 produced a potent and pressure-related stimulation of acid secretion from the Heidenhain pouch without any change in secretion from the main stomach and pancreas or in the serum concentration of immuno-assayable gastrin. 3. Graded decrease of the liver extract meal pH to below 5-0 resulted in the pH-dependent inhibition of gastric acid output, which at pH 1-0 was only about 30% of the value attained at pH 5-0. Acid secretion from the Heidenhain pouch induced by exogenous stimuli such as histamine, pentagastrin or Urecholine also showed gradual decrease when the pH of the pouch content was decreased in sequential order from 5-0 to 1-0. This pH-dependent inhibition was accompanied by an increase in pepsin secretion. 4. The pH-dependent inhibition of the Heidenhain pouch response to the liver extract meal was not altered by topical application of a local anaesthetic and atropine or by the intravenous infusion of large doses of atropine, secretin or metiamide, which were shown to cause a marked inhibition of the main stomach response to the liver meal. 5. The results indicate that there is a local and gastrin-independent inhibition mechanism of gastric acid secretion activated by an acidified meal making contact with the oxyntic gland area."}
{"_id": "492", "description": "The influence of pH on equilibrium effects of tetrodotoxin on myelinated nerve fibres of Rana esculenta.. 1. The experiments were done on single nodes of Ranvier of Rana esculenta. The effects of tetrodotoxin and H ions were determined either by the reduction of the maximum rate of rise, VA, of action potentials evoked with threshold stimuli or in the voltage clamp by the decrease of the peak Na permeability, PNa. 2. With the tetrodotoxin sample used throughout the investigation the equilibrium dissociation constant, KT, of the toxin-receptor reaction at neutral pH was determined to be 2-8 nM. Between 1-55 and 15-5 nM tetrodotoxin the normalized value, A, of VA, was found to be related to the normalized toxin concentration cT = [TTX]/2-8 nM by the empirical equation log [(1-A)/A] = 1-22 log cT-0-573. 3. On increasing the pH (up to 8-8) the effect of tetrodotoxin diminished as revealed by an increase in A. The apparent reduction of cT (as calculated from A) suggests that the toxin is active only in its cationic forms. 4. Weakly acid tetrodotoxin solutions (7-3 less than pH less than or equal to 5-5) reduced A to a lesser degree than did neutral toxin solutions in spite of the inherent depressing effect of acid pH on A (A = 0-5 at about pH 5-5). In more acid toxin solutions A decreased again and at pH 4-6 it was about equal to the value in toxin-free solution. 5. When, after equilibrium in an acid toxin solution, the perfusate was suddenly changed to neutral Ringer solution A jumped to a higher value A' as measured 1 sec after the switch. Since the blocking effect of hydrogen ions subsided within a fraction of a second while the time constant of the toxin washout is of the order of 1 min, A' reflects the number of Na channels blocked by tetrodotoxin at acid pH. 6. In acid toxin-free solution the peak PNa as obtained in voltage clamp experiments was reduced by a voltage-dependent factor (cH + 1)-1 with CH = [H+]/KH(E) and KH(E) = 2-04 muM exp (0-34 EF/RT). Adding tetrodotoxin resulted in another reduction by a constant factor p'T. 7. Experiments employing various combinations of toxin concentration (3-1-93 nM) and pH values (7-3-5-2) confirm the decreased toxin effect at low pH. Moreover, p'T was smaller (the additional toxin effect larger) when the membrane had been kept depolarized and thus cH reduced during equilibration. This suggests that tetrodotoxin cations and H ions compete for the same blocking site. A quantitative fit, however, requires additional assumptions."}

In diphasic blood agar media Trypanosoma vespertilionis developed spheroid clusters as compared to rather long, sausage-shaped (sometimes branched) clusters formed by Trypanosoma dionisii. The former species attained a greater population density (approximately 6 X 10(7) organisms/ml) than the latter (approximately 2 X 10(7) organisms/ml). Greater numbers of epimastigotes, some in active binary divisions, were observed during the logarithmic phase of growth, and morphologic changes occurred during cultivation which correlated with increased acidity and a depletion of glucose. Maximum numbers of trypomastigote forms were found during the stationary and early death phases. Most of the forms observed after 20 days were sphaeromastigotes. Glucose concentrations decreased to 0 M in T. vespertilionis and to 4.4 X 10(-5) M in T. dionisii cultures during the stationary and death phases. By the 12th day of incubation cultures of T. vespertilionis were more acid (pH 5.5) than those of T. dionisii vespertilionis and T. dionisii contained common and specific antigens. At least 2-3 common antigens were detected in extracts reacted against heterologous antisera. Specific antigens were observed as nonidentical lines formed by extracts reacted against homologous and heterologous antisera and with antisera absorbed with heterologous antigens. At least 2 specific antigens were evident in extracts of T. vespertilionis and 1 in extracts of T. dionisii."}
{"_id": "493", "description": "The influence of pH on the rate of tetrodotoxin action on myelinated nerve fibres.. 1. The experiments were done on single myelinated nerve fibres of Rana esculenta. The rates of toxin effect were studied either by measuring the maximum rate of rise, VA, of repetitively evoked action potentials or by measuring Na currents during periodic impulses in the voltage clamp. 2. VA measurements showed that in alkaline solutions (pH up to 8-8) the offset rate was unchanged while the onset was slowed in quantitative agreement with an assumed decrease in the active cationic form of tetrodotoxin. 3. Both VA measurements and those in the voltage clamp revealed a decrease in T'off, the offset time constant and in increase in the onset time constant, T'on, as the pH was lowered. 4. For tetrodotoxin concentrations, [TTX], up to 400 nM and pH values down to 5-3 the simple relation T'on/T'off = p'R held, where p'T is the constant factor by which the Na permeability was reduced at equilibrium with a given [TTX]. 5. The agreement between kinetic and equilibrium results was also valid when, at constant [TTX] and pH. p'T was modified by the holding potential during equilibration. 6. No unequivocal explanation of the results can be given but some of their features resemble acid catalysis."}
{"_id": "494", "description": "The formation of synapses in amphibian striated muscle during development.. 1. A study has been made of the formation of synapses in developing reinnervated and cross-reinnervated amphibian twitch muscles which receive either a focal (iliofibularis) or a distributed (sartorius) innervation from 'en plaque' nerve terminals using histological, ultrastructural and electrophysiological techniques. 2. During the development of the tadpole through metamorphosis to the adult frog, the sartorius myofibres increased in length at about twice the rate of the iliofibularis myofibres, due to a fast rate of growth at their insertions on to the pelvic tendon. 3. The short iliofibularis and sartorius myofibres of young tadpoles (800 mum long) possessed only a single synapse and the iliofibularis myofibres did not receive any further innervation during development. However the sartorius myofibres received further transient innervation on the new muscle laid down during development at the fast growing pelvic insertion, until the distance between the original synapse formed on the myofibres and the synapse at the pelvic end of the muscle was about 12 mm. 4. During development synapses possessed either skewed, multimodal, or unimodal m.e.p.p. amplitude-frequency distributions; the intervals between m.e.p.p.s. were not distributed randomly according to a Poisson process, as m.e.p.p.s. of similar amplitudes tended to be separated by very short intervals; the unit-size e.p.p. had a similar amplitude-frequency distribution as the m.e.p.p.s. if these had a unimodal distribution. 5. Reinnervation or cross-reinnervation of the sartorius and the iliofibularis muscles in adults or at a late stage of development simply reconstituted the normal focal and distributed innervation patterns of the muscles, as found in the control muscles of the contralateral and unoperated legs. 6. These observations on synapse formation in amphibia are consistent with the hypothesis that during development the axon making the initial synaptic contact on the muscle cells induces a property over a length of muscle membrane adjacent to this site which makes it refractory to synapse formation; thus during reinnervation or cross-reinnervation of adult muscles this refractory property constrains synapse formation to these sites."}

The isolated skin of the toad Bufo marinus ictericus when impaled from the outer surface by glass microelectrodes filled with 3 M KCl shows a voltage profile which is a continuous function of the depth of impalement. The superficial intraepithelial potential difference measured with reference to the external solution (PDi) is negative with NaCl-Ringer's solution on both sides of the skin, displaying a minimum of -26.7+/-3.6 mV at 6+/-2 mum. Null value is obtained at 19+/-3 mum, with positive values for deeper impalements. Indications of cell impalements (abrupt voltage and resistance jumps) were frequently observed at sites deeper than 25 mum from the outer surface. Measurements of the electrical resistance between the microelectrode and the external solution, made with single- and double-barreled microelectrodes, showed great discrepancies, which may be attributed to distinct pathways of different resistances in the stratum corneum. PDi measured at a depth of 5 mum was a logarithmic function of Na2SO4 or K2SO4 concentration in the external solution, increasing in negativity with a reduction in concentration. Substitution of Na by K in the external solution had only minor effects on PDi. Acidification of the external solution from pH 9 is accompanied by a reduction in the negative value of PDi. At pH 3 PDi was positive. PDi was interpreted as a diffusion potential at the tip of the microelectrode due to KCl diffusion from the electrode into the matrix of the stratum corneum. Differences in K and Cl mobilities, responsible for the origin of PDi, were attributed to fixed charges in the matrix of the stratum corneum, with density and polarity determined by their degree of proponation, controlled by the hydrogen ion concentration of the external solution. Skin potential, short-circuit current and their relationship to PDI were discussed."}

Tiny (0.2% TBS), partial thickness, non-contact radiant heat burns in guinea pigs resulted, within 3 hours, in significant edema formation and protein leakage at the site of the injury. Areas of skin distant to the burn also showed an increase in water content but no protein leakage. Pretreatment of the animals with either chlorisondamine hydrochloride or a mixture of methysergide and chlorpheniramine significantly decreased postburn edema formation and protein leakage. Liquid emulsion autoradiography revealed that leakage of protein occurs primarily in the areas of skin adjacent to the panniculus carnosus.

The location of T4D phage-induced dihydrofolate reductase (dfr) has been determined in intact and incomplete phage particles. It has been found that phage mutants inducing a temperature-sensitive dfr (dfrts) procude heat-labile phage particles. The structural dfr produced by these ts mutants was shown to assume different configurations depending on the temperature at which the phage is assembled. Morphogenesis of incomplete phage particles lacking the gene 11 protein on their baseplates was found to be inhibited by reagents binding to dfr, such as antibodies to dfr. Further, cofactor molecules for dfr, such as reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate and reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide, also inhibited the step in morphogenesis involving the addition of gene 11 product. On the other hand, inhibitors of dfr, such as adenosine dephosphoribose, stimulated the addition of the gene 11 protein. It has been concluded that the phage-induced dfr is a baseplate component which is partially covered by the gene 11 protein. The properties of phage particles produced after infection of the nonpermissive host with the one known T4D mutant containing a nonsense mutation in its dfr gene suggested that these progeny particles contained a partial polypeptide, which was large enough to serve as a structural element."}

The effect of lasting peripheral counterpulsation upon the haemodynamics and the main biochemical factors of the blood was studied in 14 dogs with intact hearts. In cases of significant tachycardia counterpulsation in a 1:2 regimen results in only a partial reduction of the resistance to the cardiac output. This does not always permit to prevent the formation of the phenomenon of an elevated myocardial contractility. The haemodynamic conditions are most optimal in a 1:1 regimen of counterpulsation. Slowing down of the cardiac rhythm was achieved by means of hypothermia."}

In acute experiments on 92 cats anesthetized with Urethane and kept under controlled respiration the mechanism of tonic activity of the pulmonary vessels was studied in the presence of a decreased partial pressure of oxygen in the alveoli. The tonicity of the pulmonary vessels was recorded during autoperfusion of the vessels of the posterior lobe of the left lung by means of a perfusion pump. Simultaneously, the pressure in the common carotid artery was recorded and the oxygen saturation of the blood was measured. Pharmacological analysis was used for the study of the mechanism of the pressor reaction of the pulmonary vessels under hypoxic hypoxy, and it demonstrated that the pression of the pulmonary vessels that develops under alveolar hypoxy is less distinct under the effect of the ganglioblocking agent Benzo-hexonium, as well as the myotropic agents Papaverine and Chloracizine. The above reaction was significantly inhibited by the blocking agents of the D- and M-serotonin-reactive structures -- Dihydroergothamine, Morphine and Novocain, and it was completely lacking against the background of the action of Izadrine and Dimedrol -- blocking agents of serotonin- and histamine-reactive structures. It can be supposed that the D- and M-serotonin-reactive, and probably also the histamine-reactive structures participate in the regulation of the interrelationship of ventilation and pulmonary circulation."}

The influence of aging on the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system was evaluated by comparing young (20 to 30 yr) with elderly (62 to 70 yr) healthy subjects. Despite comparable body sodium-fluid balance in the two age groups, serum renin concentration, plasma renin activity and aldosterone concentrations were lower in the elderly. The age-related decreases in circulating renin and aldosterone concentrations were slight while subjects were supine and receiving normal sodium intake; when upright and during sodium depletion, they were more pronounced. Inverse renin-blood pressure interrelations were noted during two of four study conditions involving normal sodium intake or mild sodium depletion (r = --0.44 and --0.47, respectively), but not during progressive sodium depletion. Plasma renin levels were decreased in the elderly regardless of the presence or absence of an inverse relationship with blood pressure. Aldosterone and cortisol responses to corticotropin infusion were unaltered in the elderly. It is concluded that aging may cause a decrease in circulating renin, with parallel lowering of plasma aldosterone concentrations."}

This deviation from the real pH value is independent of the protein concentration and amounts to 0.1-0.2 pH units in the  physiological range. The error does not occur if the pH measurements are performed in media which are free of proteins and polypeptides, respectively. If the electrolyte solution within the reference electrode is replaced (NaCl solution instead of KCl solution) the error is distinctly reduced. For this reason, this deviation should be caused by the variation of the diffusion potential across the platinum junctions."}

The late effects of various immunosuppressive insults on cell-mediated immunity in mice were studied in an attempt to assess the role of immune surveillance in the aging process. Results were obtained using susceptibility to allogeneic tumor cell challenge, graft-versus-host reaction (GVHR), blastogenic response to PHA, a thymus derived T cell-specific plant mitogen, and cytolytic activity against allogeneic tumor cells as measures of immunologic activity. In vivo studies late in life show that resistance to allogeneic tumor cells is significantly decreased in thymectomized mice, whereas those treated with cortisone, cyclophosphamide and sublethal X-ray remain unchanged. Spleen cells from only the thymectomized and the sublethally irradiated mice show reduced activity in the GVHR. No difference is seen in the activity of bone marrow cells. Results consistent with these findings were obtained in in vitro studies. Thus spleen cells from thymectomized or sublethally irradiated mice show decreased activity is response to PHA, whereas no change is seen in spleen cells from other treated groups. Hence, surgical and physical insults are more likely to induce long-lasting immunosuppression in those immunocompetent tissues whose activity normally diminishes with advancing age. Furthermore, the degree of immunosuppression seen in this study is not of the order of magnitude that one could reasonably predict a significant decrease in mean life-span."}

From these results, together with information obtained from measurements of the tyrosine aminotransferase activity and the action of mitomycin C administered one hour before the injection of hydrocortisone, it can be concluded that the increase in tissue level of the enzyme, consequent to hydrocortisone treatment, results from an increased rate of biosynthesis of the enzyme, which participates in the catabolic processes of proteins in glucocorticoid sensitive thymus cells."}

{"_id": "627", "description": "Relative pre- and postsynaptic potencies of alpha-adrenoceptor agonists in the rabbit pulmonary artery.. The rabbit pulmonary artery contains postsynaptic alpha-adrenoceptors which meidate smooth muscle contraction; its noradrenergic nerves contain presynaptic alpha-adrenoceptors which mediate inhibition of the release of the transmitter evoked by nerve impulses. Dose-response curves for the pre- and postsynaptic effects of eight alpha-receptor agonists were determined on superfused strips of the artery in the presence of cocaine, corticosterone and propranolo. 1. According to the concentrations which caused 20% of the maximal contraction (EC20 post), the postsynaptic rank order of potency was: adrenaline greater than noradrenaline greater than oxymetazoline greater than naphazoline greater than phenylephrine greater than tramazoline greater than alpha-methylnoradrenaline greater than methoxamine. The pA2 values of phentolamine againstoxymethazoline, phenylephrine, alpha-methylnoradrenaline and methoxamine were 7.43, 7.48, 7.59 and 7.69, respectively. 2. For the investigation of presynaptic effects, the arteries were preincubated with 3H-noradrenaline. All agonists inhibited the overflow of tritium evoked by transmural sympathetic nerve stimulation. According to the concentrations which reduced the stimulation-induced overflow by 20% (EC20 pre), the rank order of potency was: adrenaline greater than oxymetazoline greater than tramazoline greater than alpha-methylnoradrenaline greater than noradrenaline greater than naphazoline greater than phenylephrine greater than methoxamine. 10(-5) M phentolamine shifted the presynaptic dose-response curves for moradrenaline and oxymethazoline to the right. 3. The ratio EC20 pre/EC20 post was calculated for each agonist as an index of its relative post- and presynaptic potency. According to the ratios, the agonists were arbitrarily classified into three groups. Group 1 (ratio about 30: preferentially postsynaptic agonists) comprised methoxamine and phenylephrine; group 2 (ratio near 1; similar pre- and postsynaptic potencies) comprised noradrenaline, adrenaline and naphazoline; group 3 (ratio below 0.2; preferentially presynaptic agonists) comprised oxymetazoline, alpha-methylnoradrenaline and tramazoline (as well as clonidine). 4. Preferentially presynaptic and preferentially postsynaptic agonists had opposite effects on the basoconstrictor response to nerve stimulation. Methoxamine and phenylephrine either did not change or enhanced, but never reduced, the response. In contrast, oxymetazoline, alpha-methylnoradrenaline and tramazoline at low concentrations selectively inhibited the response to stimulation at low frequency (0.25-2Hz). 5. It is concluded that alpha-adrenoceptor agonists vary widely in their relative pre- and postsynaptic potencies, possibly because of structural differences between pre- and postsynaptic alpha-receptors. Pre- and postsynaptic components contribute to their overll postsynaptic effec in actively transmitting synapses. The preferential activation of presynaptic alpha-receptors results in alpha-adrenergic inhibition of synaptic transmission."}

Sympathoinhibitory activity after i.v. injection was tested by the bradycardiac effect in vagotomized rats; St 1697, St 363 and XY were active, approx. 1/10-1/30 of CLON, whereas NP, OM and St 91 were inactive. However, following intracisternal (i.ci.) injection of cardiovascular depression, typical for clonidine: (1) in dogs with blocked beta-adrenoceptors, the drugs facilitated the vagally meditated cardiodepressor reflex in response to baroreceptor stimulation by i.v. injection of angiotensin; (2) in dogs treated with atropine and in (3) vagotomized cats (only NP, OM and St 363) a long lasting decrease in heart rate was observed. Some of the experiments were complicated by increases in blood pressure, due to the \"leakage\" of small amounts of the highly vasopressor active drugs, from the cisternal spaces into the peripheral circulation. The majority of results indicated, that the central cardiovascular depressor effects of the tested drugs depend on their alpha-adrenoreceptor stimulating potency and on their ability to penetrate from cerebrospinal fluid or from the blood to cardiovascular centers. Relationships between the ability for penetration and the lipoid affinity are discussed."}

Gamma-hydroxybutyric acid (GHBA) in doses that increased the striatal dopamine (DA) content of rat brain failed to increase the affinity of striatal tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) for its pterdine cofactor or to change the sensitivity of the enzyme to the inhibition by DA. Haloperidol (1 mg/kg) decreased the apparent Km of striatal TH for the pteridine cofactor. However, when GHBA was injected before haloperidol it prevented the decrease in the apparent Kn of TH, in a dose related manner. In vitro GHBA (10(-4) M) neither changed the stimulation of the striatal adenylyl cyclase by DA nor its inhibition by haloperidol. These results suggest that in striatal dopaminergic terminals the Kn of TH for the pteridine cofactor is regulated by an molecuular mechanism which requires that the impulse flow in the DA neurons is unimpaired."}
{"_id": "631", "description": "Influence of peritoneal dialysis on factors affecting oxygen transport..

High erythrocyte 2,3-DPG concentrations decreased only slightly. Arterial pO2 increased slightly as negative fluid balance was achieved. The slight changes in oxygen transport parameters with dialysis suggest an interplay of compensatory factors and do not warrant modifying dialysis to limit the correction on acidosis or hyperphosphatemia.

NH4Cl was infused into the left renal artery of anesthetized dogs at 50-125 mum/kg/min for up to 110 min. Renal blood flow declined early then increased to supra-control levels during infusion. Kidneys perfused at 125 mum/kg/min for 90 min showed patchy to confluent mixtures of cortical necrosis and tubular necrosis. Experimental kidneys invariably showed lower urine osmolality than contralateral controls 48 h after perfusion. Kidneys with necrosis showed depressed creatinine clearance as well. Renal artery infusion of NH4 acetate or intravenous infusion of NaHCO3 during arterial infusion of NH4Cl prevented significant acidosis and caused minimal histological changes, but depression of urine osmolality was not prevented. It is concluded that renal ammonium concentrations up to 40 mum/liter for 90 min does not cause tubular necrosis but does impair urine concentration. Severe tissue damage followed renal exposure to high ammonium concentrations in the presence of metabolic or renal acidosis."}

Administration of cortisol to fetal rabbits resulted in a 42% inhibition of pulmonary de novo fatty acid synthesis from acetyl coenzyme A (CoA) (P = less than 0.025). This was associated with inhibition of acetyl-CoA carboxylase (EC. 6.4.1.2.) activity (P = less than 0.01) and a tendency towards decreased activity of fatty acid synthetase. There was no effect on pulmonary microsomal fatty acid elongation activity. Light and electron microscopic examination of the apex of the right lung of control and cortisol-treated animals revealed changes consistent with accelerated lung maturation in the treated animals. The in vitro activities of acetyl-CoA carboxylase and fatty acid synthetase were similar in rabbit lung and thus acetyl-CoA carboxylase activity does not appear to be rate limiting for de novo fatty acid synthesis in lung. No significant change in the activity of enzymes associated with de novo fatty acid synthesis of microsomal fatty acid elongation was found in fetal brain after cortisol exposure. However, in a parallel study on fatty acid synthesis in fetal liver, cortisol administration resulted in a 30% increase in fatty acid synthetase activity (P less than 0.025). The finding of cortisol-induced inhibition of de novo fatty acid synthesis in fetal rabbit lung may be related to the known inhibitory effect of cortisol on lung growth in the fetus."}

The ventilatory response to CO2 decreased while blood temperature was lowered until the response became absent during deep hypothermia. For normothermia and both levels of hypothermia a similar oxygen drive of ventilation was found which was equivalent to approximately one fourth of the spontaneous ventilation. It is suggested, that in the deeply hypothermic animal the normal respiratory drive is apparently of peripheral (arterial) chemoreceptor origin and when this drive is nullified or significantly decreased, gentle shivering could be responsible for stimulating the respiratory center."}

Inferences about the catalytic mechanism of acetylcholinesterase (acetylcholine hydrolase, EC 3.1.1.7) are frequently made on the basis of a presumed analogy with chymotrypsin, EC 3.4.21.1. Although both enzymes are serine hydrolases, several differences in the steady-state kinetic properties of the two have been observed. In this report particular attention is focused on the second-order reaction constant, kcat/Kapp. While the reported pH dependence and deuterium oxide isotope effect associated with this parameter for chymotrypsin are generally consistent with simple models involving rate-limiting general acid-base catalysis, this study finds a more complicated situation with acetylcholinesterase. The apparent pKa of kcat/Kapp for acetylcholinesterase varies between 5.5 and 6.3 for neutral substrates and involves nonlinear inhibition by [H+]. Deuterium oxide isotope effects for kcat/Kapp range from 1.1 for acetylcholine to 1.9 for p-nitrophenyl acetate. The bimolecular reaction rate appears rate-limiting for acetylcholine at low concentrations, while a rate-limiting induced-fit step is proposed to account for apparent pKa values and low deuterium oxide isotope effects associated with low concentrations of phenyl acetate and isoamyl acetate."}

Both show a similar time course, similar pH dependence with a maximum at pH 6.0, and similar sensitivity to inhibitors and to treatment of the chloroplasts with a low concentration of glutaraldehyde. Their light minus dark difference spectra are similar with maxima at about 520 nm. It is concluded that they are manifestations of the same phenomenon, and the slow absorbance increase at 518 nm is due to enhanced scattering. It is proposed that the light-induced changes in scattering at 518 nm reflect alterations in selective dispersion, due to proton uptake and conformational changes in the chloroplast thylakoid membrane."}

The reaction is rifampicin-resistant, requires single-stranded DNA, Mg++, deoxynucleoside triphosphates, and ATP, and is stimulated by KCl. Such soluble enzyme fractions were prepared from E. coli strains carrying the prophage mutant P1bac, in which the viral dnaB analog (ban) protein is expressed constitutively, or P1bacban, in which the expression of ban protein is prevented. DNA-synthesizing activity of ban protein containing fractions from wild-type or dnaB(P1bac) lysogens was more temperature-resistant than that from E. coli containing only wild-type dnaB protein, whereas that from dnaB(P1bacban) lysogens of dnaB cells was extremely thermolabile.

(1971) Proc. Nat. Acad. Sci. USA 68, 2532-2535) is a spectrokinetic probe of catalytic events. The interconversion of the azoTyr-248-Zn complex and its constituents is measured by stopped-flow pH and temperature-jump methods. The rate of interconversion, 64,000 sec-1, is orders of magnitude faster than that of the catalytic step itself (about 0.01-100 sec-1). Rapidly turned over peptide and ester substrates disrupt the azoTyr-248-Zn complex before hydrolysis occurs. As a consequence, formation of azoTyr-248, substrate binding, and catalysis can all be monitored while catalysis is actually in progress. The results of these dynamic studies specify a course of catalytic events, different from those postulated based on x-ray structure analysis. If azoTyr-248 is displaced, the direction is opposite to the inward movement postulated on the basis of x-ray studies and is not unique to induction by substrates, since rapid changes in pH also result in analogous spectral changes. AzoTyr-248 carboxypeptidase has all the features which are essential for mechanistic studies: (1) It is enzymatically active; (2) the spectra of the metal complex differ characteristically from those of its constituents; (3) it responds dynamically to environmental factors; and (4) the response time of the probe itself is much more rapid than is required for the measurement of the catalytic step. These combined kinetic and spectral properties of the metal complex render it a powerful spectrokinetic probe to visualize and discern microscopic details of the catalytic process."}
{"_id": "672", "description": "Ubiquinone-mediated coupling of NADH dehydrogenase to active transport in membrane vesicles from Escherichia coli.. Addition of ubiquinone-1 to E. coli ML 308-225 membrane vesicles dramatically increases coupling between NADH oxidation and active transport such that initial rates and steady-state levels of lactose and amino-acid accumulation are comparable to those observed during D-lactate oxidation. Similar but less dramatic effects are observed with the quinone and succinate or L-lactate. In the presence of NADH and ubiquinone-1, the vesicles also generate a membrane potential (interior negative) that is similar in magnitude to that observed in the presence of D-lactate. Stimulation of NADH-dependent transport by ubiquinone-1 cannot be accounted for by increased rates of oxidation of NADH, and the effect of the quinone on NADH-dependent lactose transport is not observed in vesicles depleted of NADH dehydrogenase activity. Thus, it is apparent that ubiquinone-1 shunts electrons from NADH dehydrogenase [NADH:(acceptor)oxidoreductase; EC 1.6.99.3] to the portion of the respiratory chain containing the energy-coupling site. The findings demonstrate unequivocally that inefficient coupling of NADH oxidation to active transport cannot be due to the presence of inverted vesicles. In addition, they provide further support for specific localization of the energy-coupling site."}
{"_id": "674", "description": "Mechanism of action of penicillin: triggering of the pneumococcal autolytic enzyme by inhibitors of cell wall synthesis.. During penicillin treatment of an autolysin defective mutant pneumococcus we have observed three novel phenomena: (i) Growth of the mutant cultures is inhibited by the same concentrations of penicillin that induce lysis in the wild type. (ii) Mutant bacteria treated with the minimum growth inhibitory concentration of penicillin will lyse upon the addition of wild-type autolysin to the growth medium. Chloramphenicol and other inhibitors of protein synthesis protect the cells against lysis by exogenous enzyme. Sensitivity of the cells to exogenous autolysin requires treatment with penicillin or other inhibitors of cell wall synthesis (e.g., D-cycloserine or fosfonomycin) since exogenous autolysin alone has no effect on bacterial growth. (iii) Treatment with penicillin (or other inhibitors of cell wall synthesis) causes the escape into the medium of a choline-containing macromolecule that has properties suggesting that it contains pneumococcal lipoteichoic acid (Forssman antigen). Each one of these three phenomena (growth inhibition, sensitization to exogenous autolysin, and leakage of lipoteichoic acid) shows the same dose response as that of the penicillin-induced lysis of wild-type pneumococci. On the basis of these findings we propose a new hypothesis for the mechanism of penicillin-induced lysis of bacteria. It is suggested that inhibition of cell wall synthesis by any means triggers bacterial autolytic enzymes by destabilizing the endogenous complex of an autolysin inhibitor (lipoteichoic acid) and autolytic enzyme. Escape of lipoteichoic acid-like material to the growth medium is a consequence of this labilization. Chloramphenicol protects bacteria against penicillin-induced lysis by interfering with the activity of the autolytic enzyme, rather than by depleting the concentration of the enzyme at the cell surface."}

After lethal irradiation long-lived, immunologically vigorous C3Hf mice were produced by treatment with syngeneic fetal liver cells or syngeneic newborn or adult spleen cells. Treatment of lethally irradiated mice with syngeneic or allogeneic newborn thymus cells or allogeneic newborn or adult spleen cells regularly led to fatal secondary disease or graft-versus-host reactions. Treatment of the lethally irradiated mice with fetal liver cells regularly yielded long-lived, immunologically vigorous chimeras. The introduction of the fetal liver cells into the irradiated mice appeared to be followed by development of immunological tolerance of the donor cells. The findings suggest that T-cells at an early stage of differentiation are more susceptible to tolerance induction than are T-lymphocytes at later stages of differentiation. These investigations turned up a perplexing paradox which suggests that high doses of irradiation may injure the thymic stroma, rendering it less capable of supporting certain T-cell populations in the peripheral lymphoid tissue. Alternatively, the higher and not the lower dose of irradiation may have eliminated a host cell not readily derived from fetal liver precursors which represents an important helper cell in certain cell-mediated immune functions, e.g., graft-versus-host reactions, but which is not important in others, e.g., allograft rejections. The higher dose of lethal irradiation did not permit development or maintenance of a population of spleen cells that could initiate graft-versus-host reactions but did permit the development of a population of donor cells capable of achieving vigorous allograft rejection. These observations contribute to understanding of some of the persisting immunodeficiencies that are observed in man after fatal irradiation and bone marrow transplantation. These results should suggest better approaches to more effective cellular engineering for correction of immunodeficiency diseases and for treatment of immunodeficiency diseases and of leukemias and malignancies of man."}

{"_id": "676", "description": "Purification of folate binding factor in normal umbilical cord serum.. Human umbilical cord serum was found to contain both free folate and folate complexed to a high-molecular weight factor. The complexed folate was bound to a very high affinity binder and was present in concentrations equivalent to as much as 60 ng of 5-methyltetrahydrofolic acid per ml of serum. Acidification of the serum caused disassociation of the folate-binder complex. Released folates were separated from binder by Sephadex gel filtration, zonal centrifugation through sucrose gradients, or adsorption onto activated charcoal. The separated binding factor, either saturated or unsaturated with folate, had a molecular weight of about 40,000 on Sephadex G-200 chromatography. Binding of [3H]pteroylglutamic acid was rapid and, as in the original endogenous folate-binder complex, was essentially irreversible at neutral pH. The affinity and specificity of the binder were examined by competition experiments using [3H]pteroylglutamic acid and nonradioactive folate derivatives. Oxidized folates were bound in preference to reduced derivatives, but only three to four times more unlabeled 5-methyltetrahydrofolic acid than pteroylglutamic acid was required to produce an equal level of competition. The strong affinity for 5-methyltetrahydrofolic acid, the main serum folate, suggests that the binder could be part of the mechanism by which the fetus concentrates maternally supplied folate for its growth and development."}
{"_id": "677", "description": "Intramolecular arsanilazotyrosine-248-Zn complex of carboxypeptidase A: a monitor of multiple conformational states in solution.. The red azoTyr-248-Zn complex of arnilazocarboxypeptidase, previously used to demonstrate differences in conformation of the enzyme in crystals and in solution, has now provided means to detect multiple conformations of the enzyme in solution by stopped-flow pH and temperature jump experiments. These studies identify two distinct processes. Er + H+ in equilibrium Ey (I), is the extremely rapid, Kfast about 10(5) sec-1, pH dependent dissociation of the metal complex. Ey in equilibrium Ey' (II), is much slower, Kslow about 5 sec-1, pH independent interconversion of two distinct populations of protein molecules, Ey and Ey', in which the yellow azo-Tyr-248 is different conformations. These two conformations can be differentiated readily by stopped-flow pH-jump experiments, since I is three to four orders of magnitude faster than II. Mathematical expressions derived from this mechanism accurately predict all observations over the pH range from 6.0 to 8.5. In a previous stopped-flow pH-jump experiment, Lipcomb and coworkers [Quiocho, F. A., McMurray, C. H. & Lipcomb, W. H. (1972), Proc. Nat. Acad. Sci. USA 69, 2850-2854] recognized only a single process with a rate constant of about 6 sec-1, but not the major, very rapid rate observed here. The failure to detect this fast process led to the postulation of a number of explanations intended to account for the detection of only a single, slow rate. The present observations show that the premise for those conjectures is not valid. The azoprobe reveals the existence of rapidly interconvertible substructures of carboxypeptidase A, and the results support the view that in solution, enzymes can adopt multiple, readily interconvertible and related conformations which could then either facilitate or impede catalysis. In crystals, rearrangement of molecular structure could be severely impaired or restricted, and crystallization might single out either active or inactive conformations. In the latter case, such crystals would have greatly reduced activities and markedly altered catalytic behavior, as is observed for carboxypeptidase A. In combination with detailed kinetic analysis of crystals, conformational analysis in solution should be a valuable guide to discern enzyme mechanisms and select crystals for x-ray structure analysis."}

In Experiment 1 the shock titration task was used to evaluate the antinoceptive properties of 5 different classes of cholinergic compounds in the rhesus monkey. Only scopolamine and high doses of physostigmine were effective in elevating the shock threshold. The apparent antinociceptive effect of physostigmine, however, was difficult to separate from its nonspecific behavioral depressant effect and was probably not related to an increase in cholinergic tone. Experiment 2 examined the interaction of morphine with arecoline, scopolamine and physostigmine. Only scopolamine (0.05 and 0.1 mg/kg) and high doses of physostigmine (0.1 mg/kg) interacted with morphine in the shock titration paradigm. The multiplicative interaction of morphine with scopolamine was confirmed in Experiment 3 over a wider range of doses. It was concluded that morphine and the cholinergic compounds produce antinociceptive effects through different mechanisms of the pain system."}

A single exposure to a severe stressor (either cold swim or inescapable shock) impairs subsequent performance in a shuttle avoidance-escape task (1), a deficit attributed to reduction in brain noradrenergic activity produced by these stressors. In the present paper, two experiments are described which examine how repeated exposure to such stressors affects (a) shuttle avoidance-escape performance (Experiment 1), and (b) aspects of brain norepinephrine metabolism (Experiment 2). Experiment 1 showed that, whereas subjects receiving the single exposure to cold swim or shock showed a large avoidance-escape deficit, subjects that received repeated exposure to these stressors for 14 days performed similarly to the control group that received no stressor. Experiment 2 showed that, whereas subjects that received one session of the inescapable shock stressor showed a lower level of norepinephrine in hypothalamus and cortex than did subjects that received no shock, subjects that received repeated exposure to inescapable shock or cold swim showed neurochemical \"habituation.\" Subjects that received repeated shock showed elevated tyrosine hydroxylase activity and no depletion of norepinephrine level, and both repeated shock and cold swim caused a decrease in uptake of 3H-norepinephrine by slices of cortex in vitro. Thus, it is concluded that the behavioral and neurochemical changes that were observed after the stressful conditions studied are consistent with the hypothesis that changes in avoidance-escape responding following exposure to these stressful events are due to changes in brain noradrenergic activity."}

Some of the results concerning the combination of TH and the psychotropic drug pose interesting questions for further research and bare implications for double-blind trials of psychotropic drugs. The results suggest that possibly properties of any psychotropic drug have to be related to a doctor-patient relationship within which the personal problems of the patient are dealt with. In order to evaluate such properties, special methodological precautions have to be taken. These will be briefly discussed."}

Blood pressure, heart rate, oxygen uptake, and blood values of PO2, PCO2, and pH were studied in unanesthetized rats for 8 hours. After a cardiotoxic dose of 20 mg/kg isoprenaline, s.c., blood pressure fell from 117 to 72 mm Hg, heart rate accelerated from 326 to 497 beats/minute, and cardiac work diminished by about 15%. Metabolic rate increased by about 80%, blood values of PO2 rose, and those of PCO2 fell somewhat, whereas blood pH dropped from 7.48 to 7.38, indicating metabolic acidosis. Propranolol (40 mg/kg, i.p.) and verapamil (50 mg/kg, i.p.), both of which almost completely prevented isoprenaline-induced cardiac necroses, inhibited the chronotropic and calorigenic actions of isoprenaline by about 50%. While propranolol inhibited the depressor effect of isoprenaline completely, verapamil enhanced it: blood pressure fell to 46 mm Hg. Isoprenaline-induced fall of blood pH was not prevented by either propranolol or verapamil. Decrease of blood pH and cardionecrotisation were enhanced when isoprenaline was given together with 4.8 g/kg ethanol, p.o. In conclusion, hemodynamic actions of isoprenaline, especially hypotension, seem to be nonessential for the production of cardiac necroses. Strong acidification can aggravate the cardiotoxicity of isoprenaline."}
{"_id": "742", "description": "Alterations in norepinephrine pattern in the damaged myocardium in the rat.. In the albino rat, the evolvement of myocardial necrosis induced by a single injection of ISO was accompanied by a fall in total NE. Pretreatment with propranolol and pargyline protected against ISO-induced necrosis and myocardial hypertrophy, but did not influence the ISO-induced depletion of NE stores. The depletion of NE stores is not due to impairment in synthesis or increased intraneuronal metabolism of NE since, in ISO-treated rats, neither cardiac tyrosine hydroxylase activity nor MAO activity was altered. The decrease in endogenous NE is not due to a defect in the storage of NE. The ability of myocardium to take up and store NE returned to normal within 48 hours, whereas endogenous levels returned to normal within 5 days, even in the presence of demonstrable necrosis. Thus, there is lack of correlation between chemical and morphological changes, since catecholamine depletion occurred in the absence of morphologically demonstrable tissue injury, and the function of the adrenergic neuron returns to normal in the presence of demonstrable necrosis."}
{"_id": "743", "description": "Prevention of myocardial Ca overload and necrotization by Mg and K salts or acidosis.. The crucial point in the pathogenesis of isoproterenol-induced myocardial necrotization is an abundant intracellular Ca accumulation leading to high energy phosphate exhaustion. Accordingly, in the early stage of the isoproterenol-induced necrotization process, the onset of ATP and creatine phosphate breakdown strictly parallels the acute Ca gain. In this type of necrosis, the Mg losses from the myocardium appear as a concomitant phenomenon. The hearts can be protected against the deleterious Ca overload and necrotization by increasing the plasma concentration of Mg, K, or H ions in order to counterbalance Ca according to the ration (see article). On the other hand, if Mg, K, or H ion concentrations are too low, isoproterenol-induced Ca uptake and myocardial lesions are potentiated."}

Addition of the cell soluble supernatant fraction to an assay medium containing NADPH generating system, mixed function oxidase substrate and microsomes, resulted in a stimulation of drug metabolism ranging from 12-75%. This stimulation was observed only when the supply of DADPH generating system (isocitric dehydrogenase or glucose 6 phosphate dehydrogenase) was insufficient, leading to a NADPH oxidation rate which was greater than the rate of reduction of NADP+ during the oxidation of a drug. Hence, under our assay conditions, the soluble supernate (SS) is only providing sufficient NADPH generator, and possibly relieving inhibition by the generated NADP+. Finally, microsomal lipid peroxidation measurements under these same conditions indicate negligible to no peroxidation activity in the absence of SS."}

N-acetyl-5-ASA is extracted directly from the acidified biological specimen, deacetylated, and the liberated 5-ASA subjected to a modified Bratton-Marshall reaction. The 5-ASA present in the specimen must be acetylated with acetic anhydride prior to extraction. The violet colored product of the Bratton-Marshall reaction has a lambdamax of 560 nm and conforms to Beer's law over the concentration range of 0-70 umg/ml. Average recoveries (+/- S.D., N = 6) OF 5-ASA added to rat and human urine and rat fecal homogenates were 91.6 +/- 4.9%, 102 +/- 6.0%, and 71.0 +/- 4.8%, respectively.

The trauma was likely to result in a concussion or contusion syndrome similar to that found in man; 40 animals served as controls. During the 60 min after injury observation and measurement of body functions did not reveal signs of a shock-like condition or hypoxaemia in the traumatized animals compared with control animals. Superficial anaesthesia probably did not influence the findings. Temperature and respiration were altered significantly in all the animals receiving head injuries. Blood gas analysis showed a decrease of standard bicarbonate only after the 1.5 J injury but even though hypoxaemia was not present 2,3-diphosphoglycerate values and P50 increased, compared with the control animals. The fall of plasma lipid concentrations reported probably had to be seen as a sympathomimetic effect of the minor (1.0 J) trauma.

At various pH values between 7.38 and 7.55 the Hill plots yielded straight and parallel lines over a wide range of O2 saturation, the Hill coefficient being 2.9. Half saturation pressure P50 at pH = 7.50 was 36 torr. The Bohr effect factor was -0.53. Buffering properties were analyzed by equilibrating blood samples with gas mixtures of different PCO2 at 41 degrees C. The buffer value for whole blood in the range of 3-7% CO2 was 19.3 mMol-L-1-pH-1, the buffer value for true plasma 22.9 mMol-L-1-pH-1. The CO2 dissociation curve constructed using the buffer values had a slope of 0.17 mMol-L-1-torr-1 in the PCO2 range from 40 to 50 torr. The CO2 content of oxygenated blood at PCO2 = 40 torr was 21.7 mMol-L-1. The Haldane effect factor at PCO2 = 35 torr equalled 0.30 mMol of combined CO2 per mMol HbO2. With the values of PO2, PCO2 and pH measured in arterial blood of undisturbed and unrestrained, resting ducks effective dissociation curves for both O2 and CO2 were constructed assuming a metabolic R.Q. of 0.8.

The effect of sustained hypercapnia on the acid-base balance and gill ventilation in rainbow trout, Salmo gairdneri, was studied. The response to an increase in PICO2 from 0.3 to 5.2 mm Hg was a five-fold increase in gill ventilation volume and a slight increase in breathing frequency. There was a concomitant rise in PACO2 and an immediate fall in pHa. If PICO2 was maintained at 5.2 mm Hg for several days, ventilation volume gradually returned to the initial, prehypercapnic level within three days. Arterial pH also returned to the initial level within 2-3 days. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that under these conditions fish regulate pH via HCO3/C1 exchange across the gills rather than by changes in ventilation and subsequent adjustment of PACO2. A reduction in environmental pH causes a reduction in pHa but only a slow gradual increase in VG. Injections of HC1 or NaHCO3 into the blood have opposite effects on pHa but both cause a marked increase in VG. It is concluded that a rise in PACO2 results in a rise in VG and that changes in pH in blood or water have little direct effect on VG in rainbow trout. Possible location for receptors involved in this reflex response are discussed."}

The relationship between pH and fluoride uptake in intact enamel of permanent premolars was investigated by using: (1) a sodium fluoride dentifrice, (2) a potassium fluoride + manganese chloride dentifrice, and (3) a sodium fluoride solution of the same fluoride concentration. The first part of this paper deals with the in vitro uptake of fluoride from dentifrice slurries and from sodium fluoride solutions of different pH ranging from 7.1 to 4.5. This investigation showed that there was no significant difference between the agents but that the effect of the pH was significant. The uptake of fluoride in the form of fluorapatite was more than five times larger at the lower pH level. The second part of the paper deals with the rate of fluoride uptake (increase in fluoride content) from dentifrices in the same pH range. It was shown that the three agents gave the same initial rate of fluoride uptake (about 50 parts/10(6)/min) at pH 6 and that the rate of fluoride uptake in the outer layer of the enamel was proportional to the hydrogen ion activity."}

The enzyme inorganic pyrophosphatase (PPiase, EC 3.6.1.1) from the odontoblastic layer of rat incisors has been studied by means of a radiochemical micromethod. The enzyme was incubated with 32P-pyrophosphate in tris-HCl buffer at 37 degrees C. The reaction was linear with time for at least 45 min, and the pH optimum was found to be 8.8, independent of the amount of pyrophosphate present. Heating the enzyme at 56 degrees C inhibited the enzyme activity rapidly, Mg2+ ions activated the enzyme by 15% at an ion concentration of 4 mM, while higher concentrations were inhibitory. Ca2+ ions and PO43-ions inhibited the enzyme at all concentrations. F- ions did not affect the PPiase at concentrations below 8 mM, whereas higher concentrations had an inhibiting effect. Urea was found to inhibit the enzyme at concentrations above 1.5 M, while EDTA was a strong inhibitor at very low concentrations. The characteristics of PPiase agree well with the properties of the enzyme nonspecific alkaline phosphatase (EC 3.1.3.1.) studied earlier."}

Gastric emptying of five liquid meals which differ in their physicochemical properties have been measured in control dogs and dogs that have received a Heinecke-Mikulicz pyloroplasty alone, proximal gastric vagotomy without drainage, selective gastric vagotomy and pyloroplasty and truncal vagotomy and pyloroplasty. The first two phases of emptying have been computed by the method of least squares to obtain a logarithmic-linear pattern and are expressed as relative rates: The initial post-ingestion process is characterized by beta or the average relative rate of emptying in the first ten minutes, the basic or exponential rate as beta and the change in rate from the initial to basic pattern as deltabeta. Each measure of gastric emptying was statistically analyzed to determine specific differences in rates between the operations studied. We confirmed the earlier claims that pyloroplasty alone does not change the emptying rate of liquid meals. Each measure or phase of emptying varies consistently across the operations from meal to meal tested. Initial emptying after all three vagotomies is significantly faster than control with progressive rate increases as proximal gastric vagotomy is compared with selective gastric vagotomy with pyloroplasty and with truncal vagotomy with pyloroplasty, probably indicative of gastric fundal loss of accommodation to volume distention after denervation. The basic exponential pattern of emptying is not lost after any of the operations studied. The basic rate after proximal gastric vagotomy and selective gastric vagotomy with pyloroplasty is nearly identical, slightly delayed from the control rate and significantly slower than the more rapid rate after truncal vagotomy with pyloroplasty. Possible explanations for these are discussed and imply a particular importance of the hepatic and celiac vagal fibers, sectioned only with truncal vagotomy, in the regulation of gastric emptying of liquids."}

Gastric juice from 15 normals, 20 patients with gastric ulcer and 14 patients with erosive haemorrhagic gastroduodenitis was investigated in respect of its activity on unheated and heated fibrin plates and its content of FDP and plasminogen or plasmin with immunochemical methods. Gastric juice from normals showed no activity on unheated and heated fibrin plates, and no FDP or plasminogen could be demonstrated. In the patients with gastric ulcer the gastric juice showed little or no fibrinolytic activity on fibrin plates except in 2, who had regurgitation of duodenal juice and neutral pH of the juice. These patients had equally high activity on heated as on unheated plates and no plasmin could be demonstrated. It was shown that this activity was not due to fibrinolysis, but to non-specific proteolytic activity (probably trypsin). The patients with erosive haemorrhage gastroduodenitis exhibited quite a different picture. The gastric juice from these patients showed extremely high activity on fibrin plates, the activity was higher on unheated than on heated plates. The activity was inhibited in vitro by addition of EACA and in vivo after administration of AMCA. The occurence of plasmic could be demonstrated directly immunologically in the gastric juice. By comparsion of plasmin and trypsin in various assays it could further be improved that the gastric juice in these cases contained plasminogen activator and plasmin. The patients with erosive haemorrhagic gastroduodenitis showed no increase in fibrinolysis in the blood, but low values for plasminogen and alpha2-M, and the serum contained FDP. These findings in the blood and gastric juice were interpreted as signs of local fibrinolysis in the stomach and duodenum. There is reason to assume that this gastric fibrinolysis contributes substantially to the bleeding tendency. The effect of administration of AMCA on fibrinolytic activity and the haemorrhage lends support to the assumption of such a mechanism."}

Tne ultrastructural and fluorescence histochemical characteristics of the mature rabbit substantia nigra and neostriatum have been reviewed as a frame of reference for the developmental study. Biochemical investigations were reported on neostriatal dopamine concentrations and the relative uptake and accumulation of 3H-dopamine by this tissue from fetal to adult stages, to provide quantitative data for correlation with the fluorexcence information. The development of the neurons of the substantia nigra and their axons which project to the neostriatum has been presented from their appearance at day 14 of gestation to their maturation in early postnatal life. The initial bipolar neuroblasts, which develop in the midline of the caudal mesencephalon, are fluorescent as soon as they emerge from the ependymal zone. Their fluorescent axons, which form the nigroneostriatal pathway, reach the telencephalon at day 16 of gestation and ramify extensively in the putamen by day 20, but do not enter the caudate nucleus until several days later. Some of the early fluorescent axonal profiles in the putamen are extremely large. Electron microscopic study of theis stage suggests that the large fluorescent profiles may correspond to axonal growth cones or early synapses. A distinct substantia nigra, pars compacta and reticulata, can be recognized by fluorescence microscopy by day 20 of gestation. Electron microscopy reveals that the young neurons are multipolar with numerous developing dendrites, some of which exhibit early synaptic junctions. The subsequent maturaition of these cells and the neuropil is described. The fluorescent axons of the substantia nigra grow into the putamen and caudate nucleus in a nonuniform manner forming fluorescent islands throughout the neostriatum in late fetal life. Occasionally, minute beaded fluorescent axons are found. These profiles might correspond to some of the axons with varicosities \"en passage\" revealed by electron microscopy. In an attempt to identify further the dopamine-containing axon, the ultratructure of adult neostriatum incubated in 5-hydroxydopamine was reported. Axonal varicosities \"en passage\" containing a dense \"tag\" in the vesicles were found. Most of the tagged boutons did not exhibit synaptic contacts. The possible significance of these finding s as related to dopamine secretion are discussed."}

The effect of oxygen saturation and PCO2 on brain uptake of glucose analogues was studied in rabbits. Using a modified Oldendorf technique, 14C-labeled glucose analogues with a 3H2O reference standard were introduced into the cerebral circulation via the common carotid artery, and the radioactivity of the ipsilateral cerebral cortex was counted and expressed in terms of a brain uptake index (BUI). Severe hypoxia (oxygen saturation less than or equal to 18%) resulted in approximately a 40% decrease in the BUI of 2-deoxy-D-glucose and a 45% decrease in the BUI of 3-0-methyl-D-glucose. Severe hypercapnia (PCO2 = 100 mm Hg) caused a 45% decrease in the BUI of both of these glucose analogues. Hypercapnia superimposed on severe hypoxia had no additional effect. Hypocapnia (PCO2 = 15 mm Hg) increased the BUI of 3-0-methyl-D-glucose by 35% of the control value, and this increase was extremely sensitive to competitive inhibition. When BUI values were plotted against pH rather than PCO2 for the same experiments, there was a good correlation with the calculated linear regression. These results are compared with previous findings on pathologically induced changes in brain uptake of glucose analogues, and the possible role of blood flow is considered in detail."}

The effect of blood injected into either subarachnoid space or subcortical brain tissue upon lactate and pyruvate concentrations as well as acid-base balance of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) was studied in the anesthetized dog. CSF lactate and lactate/pyruvate ratio (L/P ratio) increased progressively following the intracranial injection of blood and reached the maximum level at six hours after injection. These changes were significantly greater in animals with intracerebral hematoma than in those with subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH). An increase in CSF lactate and L/P ratio in hemorrhagic CSF seems to be caused by two different factors. Shed blood cells per se produce lactate and pyruvate, and blood in the subarachnoid space and intracerebral hematomas cause secondary changes in brain tissue metabolism by a probable reduction of cerebral blood flow. Therefore, an increase in CSF lactate with a concomitant rise in CSF L/P ratio is a useful indicator for brain tissue hypoxia, even when CSF is hemorrhagic. The association of an increase in CSF lactate to a disproportionate decrease in CSF HCO-3 was also observed in these animals."}

By means of mutants with blocked GMP-synthetase the purine precursors of riboflavin were shown to belong to guanylic compounds. Accumulation of 2,4,5-triamino-6-oxypyrimidine, 2,5-diamino-6-oxy-4-ribitylaminopyrimidine, 2,6-dioxy-5-amino-4-ribitylaminopyrimidine (DOARAP) and 6,7-dimethyl-8-ribityllumasine occurs in the riboflavin-deficient mutants divided into five biochemical groups. This fact evidences for identity of riboflavin precursors in the yeast P. guilliermondii and Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Synthesis of DOARAP by the washed off cells of the mutants with the blocked lumasine synthetase is strongly inhibited by riboflavin; cycloheximide in the absence of riboflavin has no effect on this process. Consequently, flavinogenesis in P. guilliermondii is regulated according to the type of negative feedback by means of retroinhibition mechanism. A change in the content of flavins in the cells has no effect on synthesis of riboflavin synthetase; at the same time iron deficiency in the cells evokes derepression of this enzyme. Incubation of the cells rich in iron with o-phenantroline or alpha, alpha'-dipyridyl also causes derepression of riboflavin synthetase which is inhibited by cycloheximide. A deficiency of hem in the mutants which need epsilon-aminolevulinic acid does not affect the riboflavinsynthetase activity of the cells. Evidently, in P. guilliermondii a certain form of nonheminic iron might take part in regulating synthesis of riboflavin synthetase and other enzymes participating in riboflavin biosynthesis. Riboflavin overproduction is established to require formation of purines de novo. With the absence of flavinogenesis enzymes derepression a genetic disturbance in regulation of purinic nucleotides biosynthesis results in stimulation of flavinogenesis. The properties were studied for 680 time purified riboflavinkinase from cells of P. guilliermondii as well as for three phosphatases possessing the optimum of the activity at pH 3.5, 5.5 and 8.6, which ARE ABLE OF HYDROLYSING FMN. A change in the content of flavins and iron in the cells has no effect on the activity of riboflavinkinase in this species. Evidently, the mechanisms of riboflavin and flavin nucleotides biosynthesis regulation would be different in P. guilliermondii."}

All the substrates were hydrolyzed with the enzymes of the supernatant fraction (106 000 g) of beff liver homogenate in the zone of acid pH. Optimum comditions of enzymatic reaction were tested, the dependence of reaction on the concentration of the enzyme, on time, and on temperature was determined, pH optimum was ascertained for individual substrates, and pH stability was determined. It follows from the results that the method is suitable for the determination of the enzymatic activity of proteinases of the cathepsin character."}

It is established that Ca++ activates, and Fe++ has not effect on the activity of acid and alkaline DNases, while Mg++, Mn++ and especially Co++, Zn++, Cd++, Cu++ have an inhibitory effect on them. The activities of RNases is stimulated by Ca++ and Fe++, and inhibited by Zn++, Co++, Cd++ and Cu++. Iones Mg++ and Mn++ do not affect these activities. Localization of the above mentioned enzymes was studied by means of differential centrifugation of egg homogenates. Acid DNase is concentrated only in postmicrosomal supernatant liquid, its activity being inhibited in the presence of the nucleomitochondrial and microsomal fractions. Acid RNase is also localized predominantly in postmicrosomal supernatant fraction. Alkaline DNase is found to a great extent in nucleomitochondrial fraction, and alkaline RNase - in postmicrosomal one."}

The growth and development of the two Trichomonas species were followed up at various temperatures -- 38 degrees, 36 degrees, and 32 degrees C, in order to establish the most appropriate temperature for continuous cultivation at longer intervals of reseeding as well as the temperature optimum for the fast deposition of great amounts of biomass. It was found that the Trimed medium is suitable for the isolation and cultivation of Tr. gallinarum and Tr. tenax. Temperatures of 38 degrees and 36 degrees contribute to the accumulation of greater amounts of biomass, while at 32 degrees C the growth of these protozoa is delayed and reseeding is to be carried out at greater intervals."}

Though fatt acids evidently are accumulated in the tissue-fluid, and saturation kinetics, competitive inhibition and sodium- as well as energy-dependence apparently are observed, the transport mechanism is assumed to involve solely passive diffusion, - the concept of a carrier-mediated transport for short and medium chain fatty acids seems improbable."}

By comparing the value of specific and neurohumoral indices it was revealed that the neurohumoral shifts preceded the maximal development of the immune response. On the example of studying the catecholamine dynamics the opinion on a close association between the state of the regulatory mechanisms and the effector formations responsible for the formation of specific immunological reactions was confirmed.

By quantitative stimulation of the vagus nerves of isolated rabbit atria frequency-response relations were obtained for both the electrotropic effect (reduction of the area of the monophasic action potential) and the inotropic response. An addition of hexamethonium in a final concentration of 10(-5) g/ml resulted in a diminution of vagal effectivity in the range of lower and medium frequencies of stimulation, and was connected with a shift of the frequency-response characteristic to the right. At higher frequencies vagal effectivity was increased. In contrast to the inhibitory effect of hexamethonium the facilitating action is irreversible. By raising the concentration up to 4-10(-5) g/ml the vagal effects were reduced to a large extent, and the frequency dependence of the response was abolished at medium frequencies. In the range of 20 sec(-1) to 100 sec(-1) this dependence was re-established and may be considered as a part of a normal frequency-response relation extremely shifted to the right. The time courses of both types of effect are characterized by a steep rise and a decay of the response during the stimulation period. A mathematical handling of the frequency-response characteristics provides quantitative evidence for the extent of the hexamethonium blockade of vagal ganglion cells in the atria; furthermore it leads to the conception of these cells to act as a distributing system for a homogeneous innervation by a widespread divergency of postganglionic fibres."}
{"_id": "882", "description": "Chemical relaxation studies on the system liver alcohol dehydrogenase, NADH and imidazole.. Several years ago, Theorell and Czerlinski conducted experiments on the system of horse liver alcohol dehydrogenase, reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide and imidazole, using the first version of the temperature jump apparatus with detection of changes in fluorescence. These early experiments were repeated with improved instrumentation and confirmed the early experiments in general terms. However, the improved detection system allowed to measure a slight concentration dependence of the relaxation time of around 3 ms. Furthermore, the chemical relaxation time was smaller than the one determined earlier (by factor 2). The data were evaluated much more rigorously than before, allowing an appropriate interpretation of the results. The observed relaxation time is largely due to rate constants in an interconversion of ternary complexes, which are faster than three (of the four) dissociation rate constants, determined previously by Theorell and McKinley-McKee.1,2 This fact contributed to earlier difficulties of finding any concentration dependence. However, the binding of imidazole to the binary enzyme-coenzyme complex can be made to couple kinetically into the interconversion rate of the two ternary complexes. The observed signal derives largely from the ternary complex(es). A substantial fluorescence signal change is associated with the observed relaxation process, suggesting a relocation of the imidazole in reference to the nicotinamide moiety of the bound coenzyme. Nine models are considered with two types of coupling of pre-equilibria (none-all). Quantitative evaluations favor the model with two ternary complexes connected by an interconversion outside the four-step (bimolecular) cycle. The ternary complex outside the cycle has much higher fluorescence yield than the one inside. The interconversion equilibrium is near unity for imidazole. If it would be shifted very much to the side of the \"dead-end\" complex (as in isobutyramide?!), stimulating action could not take place."}

Results show that sodium reabsorption was not tightly coupled to hydrogen secretion. Bicarbonate stimulates both sodium reabsorption and hydrogen secretion, but Tris stimulates only sodium reabsorption. Imposing an adverse chloride gradient across the proximal tubule (C1- peritubular greater than C1- luminal) decreased sodium reabsorption but did not diminish hydrogen secretion. Diamox inhibited both net sodium and hydrogen transport.

There was no difference in intracellular K+ in muscle from each of the cardiac chambers, whereas intracellular Na+ and C1-- varied, increasing in the order quadriceps less than LV less than RV less than atria. Intracellular pH, measured with [14C]DMO did not differ in any of the tissues studied. It is concluded that, in vivo, the estimated ECS incardiac muscle is lower than that reported in vitro, that [51Cr]EDTA is a satisfactory ECS marker, and that differences in intracellular Na+ and C1-- but not K+ or pH exist between muscle from the cardiac chambers."}

The effects of a metabolic and respiratory acidosis and alkalosis on intracellular pH (pHi) and K+ have been compared in cardiac and skeletal muscle from the anesthetized rabbit. The extracellular space and pHi were calculated from the distribution volumes of [51Cr] EDTA and [14C]DMO, respectively. When pHe was varied by altering PCO2, the slope of the line relating pHi to the extracellular pH (pHe) was greater (P less than 0.05--0.001) than that obtained during metabolic changes of pHe in right and left ventricles, atria, diaphragm, and quadriceps. During metabolic acidosis and alkalosis, the slope of pHi/pHe line did not vary between tissues. During respiratory acidosis, there was no difference in slope between cardiac tissues, but it was less in left ventricle than quadriceps (P less than 0.001). In left ventricle intracellular K+ increased in a metabolic (P less than 0.05) or respiratory acidosis (P less than 0.02), whereas in diaphragm it decreased (P less than 0.02). Intracellular K+ correlated with pHe and pHE-PHi. Changes in pHi but not intracellular K+ could explain known differences in myocardial function in respiratory and metabolic acidosis."}
{"_id": "912", "description": "Effects of autonomic neurohumors on transmembrane potentials of atrial plateau fibers.. Isolated canine atrial plateau fibers were treated with acetylcholine or norepinephrine to note the effects on the transmembrane potential. Acetylcholine, 1.0 or 2.0 mug/ml, consistently reduced the slope of inherent phase 4 depolarization. Increases in maximum diastolic potential and rising velocity occurred along with a decrease in overshoot. The plateau phase disappeared. Pretreatment with atropine, 1.0 mug/ml, prevented these responses, and alone this drug had no discernible effect. Norepinephrine consistently increased the slope of phase 4 depolarization. Frequently plateau fibers generated action potentials by the normal pacemaker mechanism. \"Arrhythmias\" characterized by spontaneous excitations were induced in 92% of the norepinephrine experiments. Norepinephrine also enhanced the plateau phase of the action potential and decreased the rising velocity and overshoot. Racemic propranolol, 1.0 mug/ml, blocked all the above effects including arrhythmias. Dextropropranolol, 1.0 mug/ml, did not block effects produced by norepinephrine. Acetylcholine, applied to fibers under treatment with norepinephrine, reduced the slope of norepinephrine-induced phase 4 depolarization and terminated induced arrhythmias."}
{"_id": "913", "description": "Interstitial fluid pressure and alkaline gastric secretion.. The interstitial fluid pressure of the submucosa of the gastric fundus was monitored by means of Guyton's capsules in dogs anesthetized with pentobarbital. The intracapsular pressure (ICP) was measured during secretion produced by: a) hypertonic solutions placed inside the stomach; b) arterial hypertension (200 mmHg) applied during intra-arterial infusion of histamine, and c) intra-arterial infusion of acetylcholine. The first procedure did not modify the ICP. On the other hand, whenever interstitial fluid appeared in the gastric lumen during hypertension plus histamine, the mean ICP increased, mostly due to augmented capillary filtration. The hydraulic coefficient measured in these experiments was at least 4 orders of magnitude larger than the respective osmotic coefficient. The action of acetylcholine was complex: large doses enlarged the net capillary filtration, but small doses increased the mean ICP by muscle stimulation only. Contraction of the muscularis mucosae might be the most important mechanism underlying bulk flow of interstitial fluid in physiological conditions. It is concluded that hydraulic gradients across the epithelium might account for the \"secretion\" of \"alkaline\" juice."}

{"_id": "930", "description": "Protective effect of hypothermia in cerebral oxygen deficiency caused by arterial hypoxia.. To study the cerebral protective effects of hypothermia in arterial hypoxia, anesthetized (70% N2O), mechanically ventilated rats were cooled to a body temperature of 27 C. Hypoxia was induced by decreasing the oxygen content in the inspired gas mixture either to 6-7 per cent or to 2.5-3 per cent. This reduced mean PaO2 to about 25 and 11-12 torr, respectively. At PaO2 torr, there was no change in cerebral blood flow (CBF), cerebrla oxygen consumption (CMRO2), or labile tissue metabolites. The absence of signs of cerebral hypoxia could be attributed to an effect of temperature and pH on the hemoglobin-oxygen dissociation curve. Thus, at 27 C with a PaO2 of 25 torr the total oxygen content (TO2) of arterial blood remained greater than 15 ml (100 ml)-1, about three times the value obtained at this PO2 in normothermic rats. At PaO2 11-12 torr, arterial TO2 was reduced to about 5 ml (100 ml) (-1). The hypoxia induced no change in CMRO2, a threefold increase in CBF, a moderate lactacidosis in the tissue, and a small decrease in phosphocreatine content, but no change in ATP, ADP, or AMP. These changes are less marked than those occurring at the same arterial TO2 in normothermic rats. It is concluded that hypothermia exerts a pronounced protective effect on the brain in hypoxic hypoxia, and that two mechanisms are involved. First, since hypothermia shifts the oxyhemoglobin-dissociation curve towards the left, and prevents or minimizes a rightward shift due to acidosis, it maintains a high TO2 in arterial blood at a given PaO2. Second, by reducing CMRO2, and thereby presumably also cellular energy requirements, hypothermia exerts a protective effect at the cellular level."}

The rates at which pentobarbital, salicylate, antipyrine, and quinine were transferred from the rumen of intact, conscious goats were measured. The rates at which the same drugs diffused from the blood plasma (under conditions of constant drug concentration) into the ruminal solution were also evaluated. These compounds were absorbed by simple diffusion, and the rates of transfer were a function of pH of the intraruminal solution. The diffusion of drugs from plasma into the reticulorumen allowed steady-state distributions to be established in some goats. The theoretical and observed steady-state distributions were compared. There were good correlations for pentobarbital and antipyrine, but not for salicylate and quinine. These findings confirm in vivo the general principles of drug transfer across ruminal epithelium that were derived from previous studies conducted in vitro."}
{"_id": "935", "description": "Preservation of hypoxic pulmonary pressor response in canine pneumococcal pneumonia.. To determine the role of hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction in pneumococcal pneumonia, hemodynamic measurements were made in 16 dogs before, and within 36 hours after, intrapulmonary administration of type III pneumococcus. Ten dogs with one lobe or more of pneumonia increased their pulmonary vascular resistances and slightly decreased their arterial O2 tensions. Hypoxia increased and hyperoxia decreased their pulmonary vascular resistances. During O2 breathing, arterial PO2 was less during than before the pneumonia and increased when pulmonary perfusion was diverted away from the diseased lung. In 2 dogs breathing air, forcing the cardiac output through the diseased lung caused an increase in vascular resistance that could clearly be reduced by O2 breathing. In 5 dogs, lung mast cell counts showed no decrease in the lobes with pneumonia. In pneumococcal pneumonia, the hypoxic pulmonary pressor mechanism serves to decrease blood flow to the diseased lobes and, thus, to maintain the arterial PO2. Lung mast cells could participate in this response."}

Although small and significant differences were found between the 2 sample pH, Po2, Pco2, and bicarbonate values, the correlations between the 2 were greater than or equal to 0.97 for each variable. It was concluded that although the arterial blood is the preferred sample for evaluation of blood gases and acid-base status of patients in acute respiratory distress, capillary blood appears to be a valid substitute in the management of these patients. This technique is particularly valuable in pediatric practice, where repeated arterial samples are less easily obtained."}

Its unique localization in the cells most easily damaged by ischaemia and its ease of assay provide the rationale for its use in the measurement and diagnosis of renal ischaemic injury. gamma-GT activity was measured in dogs undergoing varying periods of renal ischaemia and under conditions of local renal hypothermia and was shown to be a sensitive indicator of ischaemic injury.

In a double-blind triple cross-over clinical study, 37 patients were exposed to several formulations of mafenide acetate (Sulfamylon Cream) and their pain responses were recorded and converted to a semiquantitative pain index. The 11.2% concentration in cream was two to three times more painful than the 5% concentration. Hypertonicity  and not the pH level appears to be the cause of the pain produced by the high (11.2%) concentration. The tonicity of the cream carrier and 11.2% mafenide acetate are 1,080 mOsm/kg and 1,100 mOsm/kg, respectively, for a total of 2,180 mOsm/kg. The carrier cream without glycerol and a 5% concentration of mafenide cream were much less painful than the 11.2% concentration of mafenide. Both afforded a great deal of relief to the patients who received the medications."}

Parenteral nutrition via central venous catheterization is associated with serious risks, especially that of sepsis. Lipid emulsion (Intralipid[Sweden]), which may be administered peripherally, was evaluated for its potential to support microbial growth. Washed cultures of Staphylococcus aureus, Candida albicans, and three species of Gram-negative rods were all capable of multiplying in the emulsion at room temperature. Variations in inoculum size did not affect the growth rate. Studies comparing the emulsion to amino acid-glucose solutions (total parenteral nutrition [TPN])confirmed other reports that TPN inhibits the growth of certain bacteria but merely retards fungal multiplication. When human serum was added to the lipid emulsion in an attempt to simulate in vivo conditions at the catheter tip, Escherichia coli was inhibited while the growth of S aureus and C albicians was unaltered."}

Propoxyphene and its major metabolite norpropoxyphene have been determined in blood and liver in 29 cases of death in which propoxyphene, either as the hydrochloride or as the napsylate salt, was involved. The use of propoxyphene napsylate (Darvon-N) contributed to the deaths of 4 persons, 3 of whom were former heroin addicts receiving large amounts of this drug in connection with propoxyphene substitution programs. In the majority of cases the norpropoxyphene blood concentrations exceed the propoxyphene concentrations, although brain determinations in several instances indicate that norpropoxyphene does not cross the blood-brain barrier with the same ease as propoxyphene. On the basis of the comparative toxicities of propoxyphene and norpropoxyphene in animals and the high tissue concentrations of norporpoxyphene in man after propoxyphene administration, it is conceivable that norpropoxyphene contributes to the toxic effects of propoxyphene."}

A decrease in pH and PaO2 and a rise in PaCO2 was observed 15 minutes after administration of ketamine. Administration of atropine with and without acepromazine had no significant effect on pH, PaCO2 and PaO2. The values for standard bicarbonate, base excess and reduced pH were not significantly affected. This indicates that minor changes observed in pH, PaCO2 after ketamine administration are compensated for by the healthy animal's blood buffer system."}
{"_id": "988", "description": "Molecular nature of beta-galactosidase from different tissues in two strains of the house mouse.. One inbred mouse strain, C57BL/Kl, has high galactosidase activities in all tissues while another strain, DBA/2/Kl, has low activities determined by the Bgs locus. Beta-Galactosidase from these two strains was partly purified by a five-step procedure: acidification, ammonium sulfate precipitation, gel filtration at two pHs, and isoelectric focusing. No qualitative differences were found between the enzyme preparations from the two strains. They had identical heat inactivation curves, pH optima, molecular weight, and isoelectric points, and the Km values were very similar. It thus seems that this genetic difference in enzyme activity probably cannot be explained by a variation of the galactosidase-specific activity but rather reflects a difference in number of enzyme molecules. Eight different isoenzymes were separated from liver, kidney, and spleen. Each isoenzyme has a different electrophoretic mobility and there is a stepwise increase in molecular weight from 143,000 to 380,000 beginning with the protein having the lowest isoelectric point. A likely interpretation is that the isoenzymes bind a smaller polypeptide in varying numbers in addition to the enzymatic polypeptide per se."}

Acute administration of nicotine hydrogen (+)-tartrate enhances the activity of rat liver tryptophan pyrrolase by a hormonal mechanism. Chronic nicotine treatment inhibits, and subsequent withdrawal enhances, the pyrrolase activity. The inhibition during chronic treatment is not due to a defective apoenzyme synthesis nor a decreased cofactor availability. Regeneration of liver NADP+ in vitro and in vivo reverses the inhibition. Chronic nicotine administration increases the liver NADPH concentration. The above effects of nicotine resemble to a remarkable degree those previously shown for morphine, phenobarbitone and ethanol. All effects are compared, and their possible significance in relation to drug dependence is discussed."}

The etioplasts of dark-grown bean leaves showed ATPase (adenosine triphosphatase) activity which had a pH optimum of 8.5, was stimulated by dithiothreitol and unaffected by light-triggering. Bean chloroplasts showed a low activity of dark-induced ATPase with a pH optimum of 8.5 and a substantial amount of light-triggered activity with a pH optimum of 8.0. The light-triggered activity depended on dithiothreitol and Mg2+ and was promoted by phenazine methosulphate. Light-triggered ATPase activity was completely inhibited by 20mum-dicyclohexylcarbodi-imide. Etioplasts developed light-triggered ATPase activity in response to 30 min illumination of the etiolated leaves. During the 48 h of light-induced greening of dark-grown leaves there was a 70% increase of the chloroplast ATPase activity found after light-triggering and a 30% fall in the dark-induced activity, both expressed on a per leaf basis. As the larger part of these changes occurred during the first 30 min of illumination, it is concluded that most or all of the chloroplast ATPase was present in the etioplast, a conclusion identical with that of Lockshin et al. (1971) for maize. During 48 h of greening there was a tenfold increase in the amount of thylakoid membrane in the leaf together with an 83% fall in the ATPase activity per m2 of thylakoid membrane, measured after light-triggering."}

The isolation is described of pure cultures of three non-methane-utilizing methylotrophic bacteria which, together with the previously described Bacillus PM6, have a very limited range of growth substrates; these organisms are designated \"restricted facultative' methylotrophs. Two of these isolates, W6A and W3A1, grow only on glucose out of 50 non-C1 compounds tested, whereas the third isolate S2A1 and Bacillus PM6 grow on betaine, glucose, gluconate, alanine, glutamate, citrate and nutrient agar, but not on any of a further 56 non-C1 compounds. Crude sonic extracts of trimethylamine-grown and glucose-grown W6A and W3A1 isolates, and of trimethylamine-grown C2A1 (an obligate methylotroph) contain (i) no detectable 2-oxogltarate dehydrogenase activity, (ii) very low or zero specific activities of succinate dehydrogenase and succinyl-CoA synthetase and (iii) NAD+-dependent isocitrate dehydrogenase activity. Extracts of trimethylamine-grown PM6 and S2A1 methylotrophs have (i) very low 2-oxoglutarate dehydrogenase specific activities, (ii) comparatively high specific activities of succinate dehydrogenase, malate dehydrogenase and succinyl-CoA synthetase and (iii) NADP+-dependent isocitrate dehydrogenase activity but no NAD+-dependent isocitrate dehydrogenase activity. The activities of most of these enzymes are increased during growth on glucose, alanine, glutamate or citrate, but only very low 2-oxoglutarate dehydrogenase activities are present under all growth conditions. The restricted facultative methylotrophs grow on certain non-C1 compounds in the absence of 2-oxoglutarate dehydrogenase and, in some cases, of other enzymes of the tricarboxylic acid cycle; these lesions cannot therefore be the sole cause of obligate methylotrophy."}
{"_id": "987", "description": "Influence of some physical factors on survival of Marek's disease vaccine virus.. Cell-associated Marek's disease (MD) vaccine was suspended at dilutions normally used for vaccination in seven commercially available diluents and in tryptose phosphate broth. The stability of diluted vaccines was determined by assay in cell cultures subjected to 0 to 37 C for 0 to 90 minutes. Optimum holding temperatures for MD vaccine virus survival varied with the specific diluents employed. Some diluents afforded greatest survival when dilution was at 0 C and held at 0 C, while others performed best when dilution was at 25 C followed by cooling and holding at 0 C. Diluents which allowed greatest survival when tested at 37 C also performed well under other temperature regimes. Spectinomycin dihydrochloride pentahydrate and various buffering compounds were added to commercial diluents used for diluting MD vaccine. Additives producing osmolality of 745 mOsm/kg and higher markedly reduced vaccine virus survival. The adverse effects of high osmotic pressure were accentuated by extended holding time, elevated incubation temperature, and physical manipulations including mechanical mixing or expressing through a syringe and needle. Satisfactory MD vaccine virus survival was afforded by a commercial diluent especially formulated to accommodate the pH osmolality changes produced by adding spectinomycin dihydrochloride pentahydrate."}

Stearic acid desaturase activity was assayed in preparations from perigenital adipose tissue and liver from lean and genetically obese female mice (ob/ob). The total activity in the perigenital adipose tissue from obese mice was threefold greater than in the tissue from lean mice, but per g of adipose tissue the activity was twofold greater in tissue from lean mice. In liver, the activity in obese mice was elevated at 8 weeks of age, remained elevated up to 24 weeks and then decreased by half at 48 weeks, but at all ages was higher than that in lean mice. The decrease in desaturase activity of liver from obese mice at 48 weeks corresponded to a change in the fatty acid composition of liver lipids toward that found in lean mice. Whereas in adipose tissue much of the increased enzyme activity may be due to tissue hyperplasia, in liver it is mainly an increased activity per cell."}

Noradrenaline stimulated the incorporation of oleate into choline glycerophospholipids of guinea-pig brain synaptic membranes incubated in sodium phosphate buffer.

In Tris-CHl containing 1 mm-NaF, stimulation of incorporation of oleate into choline glycerophospholipids by noradrenaline was enhanced by ATP, CaCl2, MgCl2 and CoA plus dithiothreitol. The optimum concentration of CaCl2 for stimulation by 10 mum-noradrenaline was 10 mum. In the presence of CaCl2, the optimum concentration of ATP-2MgCl2 was in the range 0.1-1 mm. Acetylcholine, carbamoylcholine, 5-hydroxytryptamine, dopamine, histamine and gamma-aminobutyric acid also stimulated the incorporation of oleate into choline glycerophospholipids of synaptic membranes. Sigmoidal dose-response curves were obtained, similar to those obtained previously for stimulation by the same agonists of the hydrolysis of phosphatidylcholine by phospholipase A2 (Gullis & Rowe, 1975a). The initial rate of transfer of oleate from oleoyl-CoA to choline glycerophospholipid was similar to the initial rate of transfer from oleate-albumin, stimulated by noradrenaline.

The binding of Mg2+ to the wall teichoic acid of Lactobacillus buchneri N.C.I.B. 8007 was measured by equilibrium dialysis at controlled ionic concentration and pH. In an aqueous solution containing 10mM-NaCl at pH 5.0 one Mg2+ ion was bound for every two phosphate groups of the teichoic acid, with an apparent association constant, Kassoc. = 2.7 x 10(3) M-1. On lowering the pH below the pKa of the phosphate groups the amount of bound Mg2+ decreased concomitantly with decreasing ionization of the phosphate groups. Both the amount of Mg2+ bound to the teichoic acid and the apparent association constants were similar in the presence of 10 mM concentrations of NaCl or KCl but decreased markedly in the presence of 10 mM-CaCl2 because of competition between Ca2+ and Mg2+ for the binding sites. A similar effect was found when the concentration of NaCl was increased from 0 to 50 mM. The results are discussed in relation to the function of teichoic acid in the walls of Gram-positive bacteria."}

The pH-dependence of the kinetic parameters for the hydrolysis of the beta-lactam ring by beta-lactamase I (penicillinase, EC 3.5.2.6) was studied. Benzylpenicillin and ampicillin (6-[D(-)-alpha-aminophenylacetamido]penicillanic acid) were used. Both kcat. and kcat./Km for both substrates gave bell-shaped plots of parameter versus pH. The pH-dependence of kcat./Km for the two substrates gave the same value (8.6) for the higher apparent pK, and so this value may characterize a group on the free enzyme; the lower apparent pK values were about 5(4.85 for benzylpenicillin, 5.4 for ampicillin). For benzylpenicillin both kcat. and kcat./Km depended on pH in exactly the same way. The value of Km for benzylpenicillin was thus independent of pH, suggesting that ionization of the enzyme's catalytically important groups does not affect binding of this substrate. The pH-dependence of kcat. for ampicillin differed, however, presumably because of the polar group in the side chain. The hypothesis that the pK5 group is a carboxyl group was tested. Three reagents that normally react preferentially with carboxyl groups inactivated the enzyme: the reagents were Woodward's reagent K, a water-soluble carbodi-imide, and triethyloxonium fluoroborate. These findings tend to support the idea that a carboxylate group plays a part in the action of beta-lactamase I."}

To identify the functional groups that are involved in the conversion of beta-glycerophosphate by alkaline phosphatase (EC 3.1.3.1) from pig kidney, the kinetics of alkaline phosphatase were investigated in the pH range 6.6-10.3 at substrate concentrations of 3 muM-30 mM. From the plots of log VH+ against pH and log VH+/KH+m against pH one functional group with pK = 7.0 and two functional groups with pK = 9.1 were identified. These groups are involved in substrate binding. Another group with pK = 8.8 was found, which in its unprotonated form catalyses substrate conversion. 2. GSH inhibits the alkaline phosphatase reversibly and non-competitively by attacking the bound Zn(II). 3. The influence of the H+ concentration on the activation by Mg2+ ions of alkaline pig kidney phosphate was investigated between pH 8.4 and 10.0. The binding of substrate and activating Mg2+ ions occurs independently at all pH values between 8.4 and 10.0. The activation mechanism is not affected by the H+ concentration. The Mg2+ ions are bound by a functional group with a pK of 10.15. 4. A scheme is proposed for the reaction between enzyme, substrate, Mg2+ and H+ and the overall rate equation is derived. 5. The mechanism of substrate binding and splitting by the functional groups of the active centre is discussed on the basis of a model. Mg2+ seems to play a role as an autosteric effector."}

An enzyme system from Datura innoxia roots oxidizing formylphenylacetic acid ethyl ester was purified 38-fold by conventional methods such as (NH4)2SO4 fractionation, negative adsorption on alumina Cy gel and chromatography on DEAE-cellulose. The purified enzyme was shown to catalyse the stoicheiometric oxidation of formylphenylacetic acid ethyl ester to benzoylformic acid ethyl ester and formic acid, utilizing molecular O2. Substrate analogues such as phenylacetaldehyde and phenylpyruvate were oxidized at a very low rate, and formylphenylacetonitrile was an inhilating agents, cyanide, thiol compounds and ascorbic acid. This enzyme was identical with an oxidase-peroxidase isoenzyme. Another oxidase-peroxidase isoenzyme which separated on DEAE-chromatography also showed formylphenylacetic acid ethyl ester oxidase activity, albeit to a lesser extent. The properties of the two isoenzymes of the oxidase were compared and shown to differ in their oxidation and peroxidation properties. The oxidation of formylphenylacetic acid ethyl ester was also catalysed by horseradish peroxidase. The Datura isoenzymes exhibited typical haemoprotein spectra. The oxidation of formylphenylacetic acid ethyl ester was different from other peroxidase-catalysed reactions in not being activated by either Mn2+ or monophenols. The oxidation was inhibited by several mono- and poly-phenols and by catalase. A reaction mechanism for the oxidation is proposed."}

A number of parameters affecting the adsorption of rRNA and poly(A)-containing RNA to Millipore filters were investigated separately. Binding of both types of RNA to the filter was dependent on the concentration of RNA, pH and Mg2+ concentration of the reaction mixture. Both types of RNA bound to the filter optimally at slightly acid pH values. The binding of poly(A)-containing RNA to the filter exhibited a broad pH-dependence compared with that of rRNA. The ratio of poly(A)-rich RNA/rRNA retained by the filter was maximal between pH7 and 8. The presence of 1 mM-EDTA or a high concentration of NaCl (over 0.5M) decreased the affinity of RNA for the filter. The amount of poly(A)-containing RNA in the nucleus and in the cytoplasm of a plasmacytoma cell line (MPC-11) labelled with [32P]Pi was determined by the Millipore-filter technique under conditions that minimized contamination by rRNA. These data were compared with the estimations made by oligo(dT)-cellulose chromatography. The results obtained by these two methods were in good agreement for RNA labelled for short periods (up to 2h). In long labelling and pulse-chase experiments, however, contamination of the filter by rRNA of increasing specific radioactivity in the cytoplasm gave an erroneous value for poly(A)-containing RNA by the Millipore-filter technique. Determinations made on the nuclear fraction by these two methods did not show significant variation in short- and long-term labelling experiments."}

The activities of citrate synthase and NAD+-linked and NADP+-linked isocitrate dehydrogenases were measured in nervous tissue from different animals in an attempt to provide more information about the citric acid cycle in this tissue. In higher animals the activities of citrate synthase are greater than the sum of activities of the isocitrate dehydrogenases, whereas they are similar in nervous tissues from the lower animals. This suggests that in higher animals the isocitrate dehydrogenase reaction is far-removed from equilibrium. If it is assumed that isocitrate dehydrogenase activities provide an indication of the maximum flux through the citric acid cycle, the maximum glycolytic capacity in nervous tissue is considerably greater than that of the cycle. This suggest that glycolysis can provide energy in excess of the aerobic capacity of the tissue. 2. The activities of glutamate dehydrogenase are high in most nervous tissues and the activities of aspartate aminotransferase are high in all nervous tissue investigated. However, the activities of alanine aminotransferase are low in all tissues except the ganglia of the waterbug and cockroach.

Reaction of phenacetin with N2O4 in glacial acetic acid at 10(0) C gives N-nitroso-2-nitro-4-ethoxyacetanilide. This N-nitrosoacylarylamine is stable at low temperatures (--30 degress C) but unstable at ambient temperature. No intact N-nitroso-2-nitro-4-ethoxyacetanilide can be detected when phenacetin is nitrosated under conditions simulating those in the stomach (37 degrees C, pH 1). Instead, 2-nitro-4-ethoxybenzenediazonium chloride is the main reaction product found. Under the conditions applied, the N-nitrosoacylarylamine rapidly rearranges by 1,3-migration of the acetyl group. The resulting diazoester dissociates into the corresponding diazonium salt. Trapping of the diazonium ion with 1-naphthol as an azo dye provides a useful means to identify the parent N-nitroso compound and to measure colorimetrically its rate of formation. The yields obtained in dilute aqueous nitrosation mixtures are lower than expected; the reasons for this finding are discussed. Preliminary results of animal experiments show that the N-nitroso compound is a directly acting carcinogen."}

The substance 9,10-dihydro-10-(1-methyl-4-piperidylidene)-9-anthrol (WA 335) was examined for its antagonistic effects against histamine and serotonin, for its atropine-like properties as well as for a series of other qualities in comparison with cyproheptadine and pimethixene. The anti-histamine and anti-serotonin activities of compound WA 335 on the smooth muscle and the capillary do not only exceed that of cyproheptadine but also that of pimethixene. WA 335 shows an extremely strong binding to histamine and serotonin receptors. In the dose range in which it causes already an antamine effect, its oral absorption is very good. The anti-anaphylactic effect is much stronger than that of cyproheptadine. Like pimethixene and cyproheptadine, WA 335 has no distinct antagonistic qualities against bradykinin. The anticholinergic effects of WA 335 are dependent on the test object. In examinations on the bronchus of the guinea pig and the pupil of the mouse, the atropine-like efficiency corresponds to that of cyproheptadine; it is stronger on the stimulated vagus of the cat and less efficient than cyproheptadine on the stomach of the rat. WA 335 has distinct central atropine-like properties. It possesses a strong surface anesthetic activity. The effects of WA 335 on circulation are dependent on species. In contrast to pimethixene, compound WA 335 like cyproheptadine potentiates the effects of norepinephrine in cats. The reduction of the carotid sinus reflex in the cat is more distinct after WA 335 than after pimethixene and corresponds to that produced by cyproheptadine. Higher doses of WA 335 than are necessary to demonstrate antaminic effects are needed to provoke central nervous effects. WA 335 shows no analgesic potency in mice. The influence on body temperature in the rat is similar to that of cyproheptadine. WA 335 is equally efficient as pimethixene with regard to the inhibition of spontaneous motility and prolongation of barbiturate sleep in mice, and shows the same anti-emetic activity as does chlorpromazine in dogs. In contrast to chlorpromazine the behaviour of dogs and cats is distinctly altered already by doses of WA 335 which cause a slight sedation."}

In rats and mice the serotonin and histamine antagonistic drug 9,10-dihydro-10-(1-methyl-4-piperidylidene)-9-anthrol (WA 335-BS) caused stronger central sedative effects than did cyproheptadine. WA 335-BS also displayed stronger activity against reserpine- and central tremorine-induced effects than did cyproheptadine and it slightly enhanced d-amphetamine-induced effects: therefore it may have antidepressant properties. WA 335-BS proved to be very effective against isolation-induced aggression in male mice. The comparatively small anxiolytic effects may have been caused in part by the central antiserotonin properties. Like cyproheptadine, WA 335-BS increased food consumption in cats. In EEG-experiments in the conscious rabbit the serotonin-antagonistic drugs WA 335-BS and cyproheptadine exerted stronger depressant activity on the arousal reactions than did the neuroleptic chlorpromazine.

A high concentration of 14C was found in the lower sections of the intestine 4 h after administration. The 14C in the intestine was present as unchanged benorylate, as detected by thin-layer chromatography, suggesting that benorylate absorption was slow. Intravenous injection of 14C-benorylate to rats showed that the drug had a relatively high elimination rate from the blood with a half-life of 1.9 h.

The results may briefly be summarized as follows: 1. There were significant differences on hypotonic rate being one of the indexes of the gastric tonus between timepidium-bromide and placebo. The effects of 3 experimental drugs were significantly high as compared with that of placebo on peristaltic movement of the stomach. The effect of timepidium-bromide was significantly different from that of placebo on the site of arrival of barium. 2.

As shown previously, proteinases frequently associated with plasma albumin samples catalyze a very limited and specific cleavage of the albumin molecule when it exists in the F conformational state near pH 3.7. The primary proteolytic product, BPA, has a molecular weight similar to or identical with that of the parent protein but yields two large fragments of molecular weight approximately 46000 and 23000 on reduction. Evidence is presented here that cleavage occurs within the disulfide loop between Cys390 and Cys434 with no detectable loss of small peptides, the amino acid composition of BPA being identical with that of the parent protein within experimental error. Cleavage exposes a new amino-terminal phenylalanine residue and may occur at the Glx392-Phe393 bond although the possibility exists that it occurs at another X-Phe bond in the unsequenced region of residues 400-402. The damaged protein has a somewhat altered secondary structure as judged from optical rotatory dispersion and circular dichroism measurements, probably an approximate 15% loss in helicity. The hydrodynamic volume is increased by approximately 20%. However, various physical studies indicate the tertiary structure to be strikingly similar to that of the native protein. Of most significance is the fact that the protein still undergoes the N-F and N-B transitions, although in both cases they occur at somewhat more moderate pH than in the parent protein. Moreover a sensitivity of the N-B transition to Ca2+ is still seen and binding behavior toward the dye 8-anilino-1-naphthalenesulfonic acid is essentially unaltered. The results are best understood in terms of the concept of a multidomain structure which has been suggested frequently for plasma ablumin. Bond cleavage damages one domain but leaves the overall structure essentially unaltered except for some weakening of the interaction between domains."}

Other lysosomal hydrolases are not inhibited by N-bromoacetyl-beta-D-galactosylamine, with the exception of 'neutral' beta-glucosidase (beta-D-glucoside glucohydrolase, EC 3.2.1.21). The pH dependence of neutral beta-glucosidase inactivation is essentially identical to that of the neutral beta-galactosidase. Inhibition of beta-glucosidase by this galactose derivative suggests that the same enzyme may bind glucosides and galactosides. Furthermore, both neutral beta-galactosidase and beta-glucosidase are inactivated at 52 degrees C with a half-life of 7.5 min. The presence of a single enzyme with both beta-glucosidase and beta-galactosidase activities is also supported by mixed-substrate experiments."}

An activator of the (Ca2+ plus Mg2+)-stimulated ATPase present in the human erythrocytes (membrane) has been isolated in soluble form from hemolysates of these cells. Partial purification has been achieved through use of carboxymethyl-Sephadex chromatography. The resulting activator fraction contained no hemoglobin and only 0.3% of the total adenylate kinase activity of the cell. 2. Whereas the activator was released from erythrocytes subjected to hemolysis in 20 miosM buffer at pH 7.6 or at pH 5.8, only the membranes prepared at pH 7.6 were affected by it. 2. Whereas the activator was released from erythrocytes subjected to hemolysis in 20 miosM buffer at pH 7.6 or at pH 5.8, only the membranes prepared at pH 7.6 were affected by it. 3. When (Ca2+ plus Mg2+)-ATPase activity was measured by 32Pi release from (gamma-32P)ATP, freeze-thawed erythrocytes, as well as membranes prepared at pH 5.8 and at pH 7.6, expressed lower values than noted by assay for total Pi release. When ADP instead of ATP was used as substrate, significant amount of Pi were released by these erythrocyte preparations. Further study revealed (a) production of ATP and AMP from ADP with membranes and hemolysate alone, and (b) exchange of the gamma-and B-position phosphate on (gama-32P)ATP in the presence of membranes plus hemolysates. These observations established the presence of adenylate kinase activity in the (membrane-free) hemolysates and in membranes. It further supports the conclusion that Pi release from ADP by human erythrocytes (freeze-thawed) and by their isolated membranes is due to formation of ATP by adenylate kinase and hydrolysis of this generated ATP by (Ca2+ plus Mg2+)-ATPase. 4. The following points were also established: (a) absence of an ADPase in human erythrocytes; (b) the (Ca2+ plus Mg2+)-ATPase activator enhanced cleavage only of the gama-position of ATP and (c) the (Ca2+ plus Mg2+)-ATPase activator is neither adenylate kinase nor hemoglobin."}

Two ionogenic groups (acid and alkaline) are detected on cases of HRP and apo-HRP, which are responsible for stable HRP conformation. HRP stability within the pH range 5-10 exceeded 30 times that of apo-HRP, while the stability apo-HRP-PP complex is similar to that of apo-HRP. The data obtained show that formation of complex of apo-HRP with PP, an analogue of the prostetic group lacking central Fe atom, practically does not affect the stability of HRP protein globula at pH 5-10, but significantly stabylized apo-HRP at the extreme pH values.

Absorption spectrum of serinesulfhydrase has a maximum at 430 nm what is characteristic of numerous pyridoxal-P enzymes. The position of this maximum does not depend on pH (within its range 6--10) and the presence of  L-serine, a primary enzyme substrate. An essential change in the absorption spectrum of enzyme was observed in the presence of some thiol compound--DL-homocysteine, beta-mercaptoethanol and glutathione (cosubstrates of the reaction) and L-cysteine (a primary reaction substrate).

High AMP concentrations inhibit the enzyme at high substrate concentrations. The reduced glutathion dose not influence the enzyme and does not alter the activating effect of AMP.

{"_id": "1121", "description": "Hypothesis on the role of liganded states of proteins in energy transducing systems.. In energy transducing systems the direction of energy transfer is proposed to be maintained by the synchronized turnovers of the conformational change of one protein coupling up to affect another. Catalysis by those systems implies, therefore, that under new space restrictions the groups of the transducing enzyme increase and decrease reactivity between themselves, with activatory and/or inhibitory ligands (H+, H2O, metals, etc.) and with the electron shells of the reactant molecules. The exergonic reaction-dependent turnover of the forms of the enzyme within the transition complexes would be maintained, therefore, under asymmetric phase angles of conformational-dependent reactivity that would effectively restrict the microscopic reversibility of transducing systems. Some well known reactions, such as hemoglobins Bohr effect, can be used to illustrate that microscopic (molecular) interactions subject to thermodynamic equilibria laws may similarly paricipate as driving forces in energy transducing sytems. This would allow the thermodynamic description of the role of proton translocation as that of a modificatory force of the structural parameters of proteins. Similarly, the relationship between the liganded states of hemoglobin and its change in conformation has been used to develop an illustrative model relating changes in oxido-reduction of electron carriers to induced-fit effects leading to a sequence of ATPase forms in transition complexes which become stabilized as high energy intermediates under the constraints imposed by the membrane of energy transducing organelles."}

Presumably, the shift is a reflection of the negative charge on the surface of the glass. The Michaelis constant and Vmax of soluble subtilisin BPN' with TAME were two and one orders of magnitude, respectively, lower than with ethyl lactate. Vmax, calculated per g of active enzyme, with TAME as the substrate was not affected by immobilization, while Vmax with ethyl lactate decreased greater than tenfold. The apparent KM decreased on immobilization with ethyl lactate as substrate and increased with TAME. Results are explained in terms of diffusional resistance and a possible attraction of ethyl lactate to the glass surface. Active site titration indicated that about 25% of the immobilized enzyme was active."}

The effect of NADH, succinate and ATP on the sensitivity of a number of energy-dependent functions of submitochondrial particles ot phospholipases A, C and D has been studied. It has been shown that in the conditions of oxidation of NADH and succinate by oxygen and also of ATP hydrolysis, the decrease in the phosphorylating activity of the particles under the action of phospholipases C and D accelerates. No such acceleration has been observed with phospholipase A. For other two functions, i. e. reverse electron transfer (ATP-dependent NAD+ reduction by succinate) and ATP-dependent transhydrogenase reaction the results proved to be different. Oxidizable substrates and ATP promoted the maintenance of these functions in the presence of phospholipase A, but did not retard their suppression by phospholipases C and D. The effects of NADH, succinate and ATP on the sensitivity  of different energy-dependent functions of submitochondrial particles to phospholipases A, C and D could be removed by the uncoupling agent carbonyl cyanide-m-chlorophenyl hydrazone.

Bone-marrow transplantation (BMT) from an unrelated, HL-A-phenotype-identical, MLC-negative donor was performed in a 31 year old woman with severe longlasting aplastic anemia. In vitro assays failed to demonstrate humoral or cellular sensitization of the recipient against donor-type antigens. Following conditioning with cyclophosphamide, prompt but only transient engraftment of the transplant occurred accompanied by signs of mild graft-versus-host-disease (GVHD) of the liver. The results of a second bone marrow transplantation from the same donor cannot be evaluated due to early death of the recipient. It is concluded that bone marrow from unrelated, HL-A and MLC-identical donors may engraft without severe GVHD. Rejection of the graft in our patient may have been related to greater antigenic differences that can be expected to exist between HL-A and MLC-identical unrelated individuals than between HL-A and MLC-identical siblings. However, insufficient preparative immunosuppression with cyclophosphamide due to severe hepatic hemosiderosis appears equally likely as the cause of graft rejection. The possibly increased risk of graft rejection or severe GVHD should not preclude the use of unrelated HL-A and MLC-identical marrow donors, when histocompatible sibling donors are not available; but more potent immunosuppressive regimens than the cyclophosphamide protocol may be necessary to ensure permanent engraftment."}

A transplantable mouse testicular teratoma (OTT 6050) which displays a spectrum of neuroepithelial differentiation was evaluated biochemically for concentrations of cyclic AMP (cAMP), serotonin (5-HT), and enzymes involved in the metabolism of the biogenic amines and acetylcholine. These values were compared between teratomas with neuroepithelial differentiation as the major or minor component and brains of neonatal and adult mice of related strains. cAMP, 5-HT, tryptophan hydroxylase (TPH), aromatic amino acid decarboxylase (AADC) and monoamine oxidase (MAO) were present. In addition, enzymes of the adrenergic system, i.e. tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) and dopamine-beta-hydroxylase (DBH), and of the cholinergic system, i.e. choline acetyltransferase and acetylcholinesterase, were studied. Biochemical differences in tumor groups probably reflected variations in the proportion of neuroepithelial components: trends suggested an increase of cAMP and an increased activity of TPH, AADC, TH and DBH in tumors with increased proportions of neuroepithelial cells. These findings indicate that the neuroepithelial component of the mouse teratoma may serve as a model for the study of neuronal differentiation in primitive neuroepithelial neoplasms."}
{"_id": "1141", "description": "Trans-synaptic regulation of the development of end organ innervation by sympathetic neurons.. To examine the regulation of development of end organ innervation the superior cervical ganglion (SCG), and two of its target organs, the iris and pineal gland, were studied using biochemical and histofluorescent approaches. During postnatal ontogeny the activity of tyrosine hydroxylase (T-OH), which is localized to adrenergic neurons, increased 50-fold in iris, and 34-fold in pineal nerve terminals of the rat. These increases paralleled the in vitro rise in iris [3H]norepinephrine ([3H]NE) uptake, a measure of the presence of functional nerve terminal membrane. These biochemical indices of end organ innervation correlated well with developmental increases in density of innervation, adrenergic ground plexus ramification and nerve fiber fluorescence intensity as determined by fluorescence microscopy. Unilateral transection of the presynaptic cholinergic nerves innervating the SCG in 2-3-day-old rats prevented the normal development of end organ innervation: T-OH activity, [3H]NE uptake, innervation density, plexus ramification and fluorescence intensity failed to develop normally in irides innervated by decentralized ganglia. It is concluded that trans-synaptic factors regulate the maturation of adrenergic nerve terminals, and the development of end organ innervation by SCG."}

Rat placental alkaline phosphatase (EC 3.1.3.1), a dimer of 135,000 daltons, is strongly activated by Mg2+. However, Zn2+ has to be present on the apoenzyme to obtain this activation. Mg2+ alone is unable to reconstitute functional active sites. Excess Zn2+ which competes for the Mg2+ site leads to a phosphatase with little catalytic activity at alkaline pH but with normal active sites at acidic pH as shown by covalent incorporation of ortho-[32P]phosphate. Two enzyme species with identical functional active sites have been reconstituted that only differ by the presence of Zn2+ or Mg2+ at the effector site. A mechanism is presented by which alkaline phosphatase activity of rat placenta would be controlled by a molecular process involving the interaction of Mg2+ and Zn2+ with the dimeric enzyme molecule."}

The pH profiles of the steady-state parameters show the two usual important pK's. The basic one, pK2 = 9.6, affects both Km and kcat/Km and probably controls the binding conformation of chymotrypsin. The acidic one, pK1 = 5.7, affects kcat and kcat/Km and plays a role in the catalytic process. The value of pK1 is unusually low."}

The free and bound forms of alpha,alpha-trehalase (EC 3.2.1.28) of the honey bee thorax were separated and the bound enzyme was solubilized by raising the pH to 8.0 for 10 h. Both enzymes were purified. They were homogeneous as determined by several electrophoretic criteria. It was found that the two enzymes had very similar Km's (each about 0.89 mM), Vm's (53.2 and 54.3 U/mg for free and solubilized, respectively), inhibition characteristics, specificities (both only hydrolyzed alpha,alpha-trehalose), pH maxima (each had maxima at about 3.5 and 6.5), molecular weights (65,000), isoelectric points (5.1), reactivities to sulfhydryl reagents, electrophoretic mobilities, activation energies (about 12.8 kcal/mol), and similar stabilities to heat, pH, and urea. Some significant differences between the two enzymes were, however, found: the solubilized alpha,alpha-trehalase floated at 70% saturation of ammonium sulfate while the free alpha,alpha-trehalase did not; the solubilized alpha,alpha-trehalase did not dissociate into subunits as readily as did the free one; and the solubilized alpha,alpha-trehalase was found to bind more readily to a hydrophobic grouping than the free enzyme. In addition to these comparisons, three new findings relating to thorax alpha,alpha-trehalases are reported. (1) Thorax alpha,alpha-trehalases are strongly inhibited by beta-glucosides (Ki values of about 8 x 10(-4) M); (2) under certain conditions thorax alpha,alpha-trehalases from honey bees dissociated into subunits of one-half the normal molecular weight; (3) honey bee thorax alpha,alpha-trehalases have unusual biphasic pH activity profiles."}

Immunotherapy of cancer is of interest to oncologists because it is specifically directed to cancer cells, sparing normal cells. While it is ineffective in most patients, especially those with widespread metastatic disease, it occasionally produces good results. Each of the available methods has inherent problems and, recently, attempts have been made to overcome some of these. There is a strong case for small-scale experimental trials in highly selected groups of patients who are intensively investigated for their immunologic status in relation to their tumour. Despite the lack of success in general, immunotherapy still appears to have a future as an adjunct to existing therapy in order to control as much as to cure residual tumour."}

Previous studies on renin release by an in vitro system of rat kidney slices, which is devoid of hemodynamic influences, have provided evidence that renin release is stimulated by a beta-adrenergic mechanism. We used this system to study effects of tyramine (an indirectly acting amine capable of displacing endogenous catecholmines from sympathetic nerve endings) on renin release. Tyramine (10(-3)M) in the presence of a monoamine oxidase inhibitor (pheniprazine, 10(-5)M) and a phosphodiesterase inhibitor (theophylline, 10(-3)M) significantly (P less than 0.01) stimulated renin release when values were compared to control observations for media containing only the inhibitors. Tyramine-induced stimulation of renin release was blocked by the beta-blocking agent, propranolol (2 X 10(-4) M), and the neural uptake blocking agent, cocaine (10(-5) M), but not by the alpha-antagonist, phentolamine (9 X 10(-4) M). These observations demonstrate a potential role for the sympathetic innervation of the juxtaglomerular apparatus on renin release."}

The isoenzyme that is principally of bone origin cannot be identified as such without the help of other diagnostic aids and the patient's medical history. All human tissues contain alkaline phosphatase, many organs more than one of the isoenzymes. Liver alkaline phosphatase, which constitutes 40-50% of normal serum alkaline phosphatase activity, was measured in the serum of persons with various liver diseases. Its activity exceeded normal in all types of liver disease; in 80% of cases this increase was accompanied by increased gamma-glutamyl-transferase activity, but the quantitative correlationship (r = 0.54) was not as good as expected if both enzymes come from the same source and are indices of liver dieases. Liver alkaline phosphatase activity increases in the blood early in liver disease, before most liver tests show abnormalities. The other major isoenzyme of normal serum probably represents a mixture of isoenzymes from bone and reticulo-endothelial and vascular tissues, which all contain the same \"very heat-labile\" alkaline phosphatase. Cord blood and children's sera contain mostly this very heat-labile isoenzyme."}

Sensitivity is limited by the sensitivity and precision of the method of measurement. The CV for the fractionation can be held to less than 4.0% at 65 U of MB per liter. Current fractionation methods are compared to the proposed procedure.

The data show further that the relationship between effectiveness and time depends on the way in which antagonism is measured. If the dose ratio to isoproterenol (DR) is measured, then (DR-1) declines with time in parallel with drug concentration. On the other hand, if propranolol's effects are measured as percentage reduction in a given response, then this declines linearly with time, even though plasma concentrations decline exponentially. This fact explains why confusion has in the past arisen concerning the relationship of the duration of beta blockade and pharmacokinetic half-life."}
{"_id": "1168", "description": "Fluroxene toxicity induced by phenobarbital..

Two animals were sacrificed after a single 4-hr exposure to obtain control measures of fluroxene metabolites in tissues. Four monkeys that had previously survived received exposures to fluroxene and 3 monkeys that had no exposure to fluroxene died during fluroxene anesthesia after treatment with phenobarbital (mean time, 3 hr). Toxicity was manifested by arterial hypotension, pulmonary edema, and arterial hypoxemia. Phenobarbital treatment enhanced production of fluroxene metabolites, including the highly toxic trifluoroethanol. Concentrations of trifluoroethanol in mixed-expired gas, blood, and urine, and of total nonvolatile fluorine in blood, urine, and tissues of animals treated with phenobarbital were 2 to 10 times as in control animals.

Plasma and urine were collected at frequent intervals for PCA and N-acetyl PCA (NAPA) analysis. Urine flow rates varied markedly between the water deprivation and water excess states (approximately 1.2 vs 5 ml/min, respectively), and urine pH varied markedly between the acid and alkali load states (pH = ca 5 vs 8, respectively). Despite this marked variation, there were no significant changes in PCA renal clearance or 24-hr PCA or NAPA excretion. If passive diffusion of PCA were taking place, such flow and pH changes would have caused marked changes in PCA clearance were the pH partition hypothesis true. We therefore conclude that passive diffusion is not an important mechanism in the renal elimination of PCA in man and that there must be tubular secretion. The implication for the clinical use of the drug is that dose adjustments need not be made in response to variations in urine flow and pH."}

After 20-mg oral intakes by psychiatric patients, the 24-hr urinary excretion of p-chlorophenoxyacetamide amounted to about 2-4% of the iproclozide dose administered."}

Repeated oral treatment of male rats with piperazine-substituted phenothiazine drugs in doses of 25 mg/kg or more daily led to an accumulation of metabolites containing an ethylenediamine group instead of the piperazine ring. These products of ring degradation with and without removal of the N-alkyl group were found, together with the parent drugs and their N-dealkylated metabolites, in liver, lung, kidney, and spleen, as well as in brain when high doses were administered. After termination of treatment, the ethylenediamine derivatives were eliminated more slowly than were their congeners containing the intact piperazine ring. Parallel observations were made in dogs given fluphenazine in daily doses of up to 40 mg/kg. Quantitative differences were observed in the relative amounts of mono- and disubstituted ethylenediamine metabolites accumulated in rat tissues during treatment with the various drugs; the proportion of the monosubstituted product formed by N-dealkylation and ring cleavage declined in the following order: perazine, prochlorperazine, trifluoperazine, fluphenazine, perphenazine. Condensation products of the ethylenediamine derivatives with formaldehyde were split in the extraction procedure used."}

Urinary metabolites, representing 65, 74, and 87%, respectively, of the total urinary radioactivity excreted by these three species, were isolated by preparative layer chromatography and characterized by various spectral techniques including gas chromatography/mass spectrometry, solid probe mass spectrometry, polarimetry, and infrared and nuclear magnetic resonance spectrometry. No parent drug was found in the urine of any species. Four metabolites were isolated from the rat including the 4'-hydroxyphenyl, dihydrodiol, and 3'-methoxy-4'hydroxy derivatives. N-demethylated metabolites were not isolated from rat urine. Five metabolites were isolated from dog urine, including 4-hydroxyphenyl, dihydrodiol, and catechol derivatives of triflubazam. Unlike the case of the rat, a catechol-O-methyl ether was not detected in dog urine. Six metabolites were isolated from monkey urine. The only major difference in metabolism in the monkey was the existence of both the dihydrodiol and N-desmethyldihydrodiol metabolites. No catechol-0-methyl ether was detected in monkey urine. Biotransformation through a common arene oxide intermediate can be proposed for these three animal species."}

In three healthy men about 20% of the radioactivity was excreted in the urine within 24 hr after an oral dose of [20-3H]spironolactone (200 mg + 200 muCi). About half of this radioactivity was extracted with chloroform at pH 3 and from this extract four stable metabolites were isolated by use of column and thin-layer chromatography. Two of these were the previously identified metabolites, canrenone (VII; 2.9% of dose) and the 6beta-hydroxy-sulfoxide (X; 1.8% of the dose). The remaining were the new metabolites, 15alpha-hydroxycanrenone (XI; 0.8% of dose) and the 6beta-hydroxy-thiomethyl derivatives (VI; 0.5% of dose). The principal water-soluble urinary metabolite was canrenoate ester glucuronide (XII; 4.5% of dose).

Peak levels of plasma radioactivity occurred in 1-2 hr after oral administration. The dose was 10 mg/kg in rats and dogs, and 50 or 500 mg in man. Most of the drug in plasma was intact MK-647 which was extensively bound to plasma protein. In man the peak concentration following the 500-mg dose was approximately 10 times that after the lower dose, which suggests that absorption rates of both doses were similar. Elimination of drug from plasma was dose-dependent. The area under the curve for MK-647-14C in plasma was 18 times higher following the 500-mg dose than the 50-mg dose. Dogs given 10 mg/kg orally or intravenously excreted 44% of the dose in the urine and 42% in the feces in 72 hr. Rats given the same dose level by either route of administration excreted 80% in the urine and 11% in the feces. In man approximately 95% of a 50- or 500-mg oral dose was excreted in the urine and 3% in the feces, in 96 hr. MK-647 and two metabolites were present in the urine of three species. The ether and ester glucuronides were identified in human urine. The latter metabolite was also identified in rat and dog urine. The glycine conjugate of MK-647 was not observed in the urine of the three species. No interaction was observed between MK-647 and bishydroxycoumarin in the prothrombin time test nor with tolbutamide in the glucose tolerance test. A significant lowering of hexobarbital sleeping time was observed in female, but not male rats after four consecutive daily doses of MK-647. After repeated daily administration of MK-647 (12.5-100 mg/kg), the diurnal plasma level in dogs was not significantly altered, indicating that no saturation, induction, or inhibition of its own metabolism took place."}

This effect has been shown not to be due to inhibition of hydrolysis of acetaminophen or interference with its determination, or to preferential formation of other phenolic metabolites. This effect of metyrapone is remarkably substrate-specific: phenol formation from the homologues of acetanilide, formanilide and propionanilide, and that from the sulfonamide analog of acetanilide, methanesulfonanilide, is inhibited by metyrapone over the concentration range in which acetanilide hydroxylation is enhanced.

The metabolism of 14C-griseofulvin has been compared in rat liver microsomes, isolated perfused rat livers, and rats with bile duct cannulas. In all three preparations, 4-desmethylgriseofulvin and 6-desmethylgriseofulvin were the major metabolites. The ratio of total 4-desmethylgriseofulvin to 6-desmethylgriseofulvin formed was 1.20, 0.89, and 1.01 in liver microsomes, isolated perfused livers, and rats with bile duct cannulas, respectively. After a 7-min incubation with liver microsomes, most (96%) of the griseofulvin remained unchanged. Only small amounts of 4-desmethylgriseofulvin (1.26%) of dose) and 6-desmethylgriseofulvin (1.05% of dose) were formed. In isolated perfused liver, most of the drug (59% of dose) was excreted into bile within 4 hr, primarily as 4-desmethylgriseofulvin (24% of dose) and 6-methylgriseofulvin (24% of dose). In animals with bile duct cannulas, 65% of the dose was excreted into bile and 18% of the dose into urine within 4 hours. In bile, 32% of the dose was excreted as 4-desmethylgriseofulvin and 20% of the dose as 6-desmethylgriseofulvin, whereas in urine the drug was excreated predominantly as 6-desmethylgriseofulvin (13% of dose) with only a small amount of 4-desmethylgriseofulvin (1% of dose), during the first 4 hr. These results show that there is good correlation in the metabolic fate of 14C-griseofulvin in the liver microsomes, isolated perfused liver, and rats with bile duct cannulas. In addition to the similar ratio of 4-desmethylgriseofulvin to 6-desmethylgriseofulvin, there is also an agreement in the extent of metabolism and biliary excretion in isolated perfused liver and in rats with bile duct cannulas, which suggests that the isolated perfused liver is an important technique for studying drug metabolism in animals."}

The mixed-function oxidation of 14C-labled 2-acetylaminofluorene (AAF) was investigated in placental and fetal tissues of humans and monkeys (Macaca nemestrina) in vitro. The major metabolite formed in most tissues was 7-hydroxy-AAF. Rates of the hydroxylation reactions varied widely among the tissues investigated and were generally one to two orders of magnitude lower than those measured in rat hepatic tissues. High correlations among rates of 7-,5-, and 3- and between 1- and N-hydroxylations of AAF were observed. The latter two reactions were less responsive to inhibition by carbon monoxide. Rates of 3-hydroxylations of benzo[a]pyrene (BP) also were highly correlated with rates of 7-, 5-, and 3-hydroxylations of AAF but were not correlated with rates of 1- and N-hydroxylations in human placental microsomes. A lack of statistically significant correlations was observed among rates of many of these hydroxylation reactions studied in primate fetal tissues. Rates of 7-, 5-, and 3-hydroxylations of AAF were not statistically correlated with rates of 3-hydroxylation of BP in homogenates of primate fetal tissues in most instances, but statistically significant correlations among rates of 3-hydroxylation of BP and 1- and N-hydroxylations of AAF were observed in those preparations. The results suggested two separate mechanisms for the genetic control of rates of placental aromatic ring- and N-hydroxylation reactions as opposed to apparent multiple genetic controls for rates of these hydroxylation reactions in primate fetal tissues."}

The absorption of dl-methadone from the gastrointestinal tract of the Sprague-Dawley rat was examined by the in vivo segment technique. Duodenal absorption, measured as a function of time and dose, followed first-order kinetics with a half-life of 15.6 min. Absorption was not influenced by prior or concomitant administration of a variety of drugs. Absorption from other regions of the intestine was similar to that from the duodenum; in contrast, absorption from the stomach was markedly slower. Gastric absorption was increased by alkalinization of stomach contents but was still considerably slower than from the duodenum. Gastric emptying of methadone appears to be the rate-limiting step in the overall gastrointestinal absorption of the drug, since the rate of emptying following intubation of the drug into the stomach was also considerably slower than the rate of duodenal absorption."}

The time-concentration curve of administered drug was biphasic in monkeys and men, while in rats the kinetics of a one-compartment model were observed. Distribution studies of 14C-labeled drug in the rat showed that most of the radioactivity was excreted in the feces and that significant quantities of 14C were sequestered by depot fat. Monkeys and human subjects both eliminated Win 35,833 primarily through the kidneys. The drug was excreted in rat bile and human urine, both as the free acid and conjugated with glucuronic acid. At physiological concentrations, Win 35,833 was extensively bound to rat, monkey, and human plasma proteins.

The N-demethylation of ethylmorphine was competitively inhibited by HPPH, whereas inhibition of the hydroxylation of aniline was not competitive. The spectrum produced by HPPH when added to microsomal suspensions does not resemble the classical type I or type II spectra, but rather a reversed type I spectrum. Spectral evidence is presented indicating that HPPH also diminishes the magnitude of the spectral change produced by type I and II compounds."}

The 24-hr LD50 of colchicine was relatively constant in rats over 25 days of age. In an attempt to determine the mechanism of the increased sensitivity of the newborn rat to the toxic action of colchicine, the distribution of 3H after the administration of 3H-colchicine (0.1 mg/kg) was measured in 10- and 35-day-old rats. The concentration of 3H was higher in all tissues of the newborn than the adult after ip administration, suggesting an immaturity in the pathway for colchicine elimination. After iv administration, radioactivity disappeared much more slowly from the plasma of the newborn rat than from the adult. This was due to a lower capacity of the liver of the newborn to concentrate colchicine and to excrete it into the bile. Development of the hepatic excretory mechanism responsible for excretion of colchicine occurred at the same age as did the increase in LD50. These results suggest that colchicine is more toxic in the newborn because the drug remains in the body for a longer time due to immaturity of the liver excretory process."}

The effect of Walker tumor on sulphacetamide distribution was studied in rats 21 days after tumor implantation in a hind leg. After oral administration of sulphacetamide (5 and 20 min), the concentration of the drug was found to be lower in the plasma and liver of tumor-bearing rats when compared with that of control group. However, 90 min after sulphacetamide administration, the concentration of the drug in these same tissues was found to be higher in tumor-bearing rats than in control animals. Whereas the tumor had no apparent effect on sulphacetamide concentration in the brain, drug concentrations in the fat tissue of tumor-bearing rats were constantly higher than those of control animals. These changes in sulphacentamide disposition kinetics could be explained in part by delay in gastrointestinal absorption of the drug. Contrary to what was observed after oral administration, constantly higher drug concentrations were found in the plasma of tumor-bearing rats after iv injection of sulphacetamide. Furthermore, the half-life of sulphacetamide in these same animals was much higher than in control animals. It is concluded that, in Walker tumor-bearing rats, there are changes in the kinetics of sulphacetamide which are functions of the route of administration of the drug."}

We studied the disposition and pharmacokinetics of Poloxamer 108 in rats as an initial step towards understanding its behavior in man. After iv administration in rats, about 94% of 7 or 100 mg/kg doses of ethylene-14C-labeled polymer was excreted in the urine in 3 days. About 6% of the label appeared in feces. Erythrocyte membranes were not permeable to the polymer, and only the parent compound was demonstrable in urine. Twenty hours after dosing, small residues were detectable only in the kidney, liver, small intestine, and carcass. The third phase of the plasma disappearance pattern was evident only at the larger dose, but plasma disappearance kinetics were independent of the dose in the range used here. Thus, most of poloxamer 108 was eliminated rapidly in rats by renal excretion, and a smaller portion probably was removed by biliary excretion. These results will be applied to continuing studies of Poloxamer 108 disposition in man."}

The uptake, metabolism, and release of aldrin and dieldrin by the lungs were studied by use of isolated perfused rabbit lungs that were artificially ventilated and perfused through the pulmonary artery. Both recirculating and single-pass experiments were conducted using an artificial medium as perfusate. Aldrin accumulated in the lung from the perfusate through two distinct phases of uptake: a rapid phase involving simple diffusion and nonspecific binding and a slower phase representing its metabolic turnover as dieldrin. Dieldrin was not metabolized but accumulated in the lungs by a saturable and a nonsaturable process. Single-pass experiments with aldrin indicated that the initial velocity of uptake could be fitted to one component and a constant representing the rate of metabolism. Uptake of dieldrin was biphasic: one phase independent of the perfusate concentration and the other saturable with respect to the perfusate concentration. By the application of Michaelis-Menten kinetics, the maximum amount of dieldrin accumulation attributable to the saturable component was calculated to be 0.64 mumol/lung. Our results indicate that the accumulation of these chlorinated xenobiotics takes place through the processes of simple diffusion followed by nonspecific tissue binding. There was no evidence for irreversible binding of aldrin or dieldrin, its epoxide, in the lung. While the lung plays a role in metabolizing aldrin to dieldrin followed by a transient storage, neither substrate has the potential for long-term storage in the lung."}

The values obtained for corrected microsomal protein in untreated female Sprague-Dawley rats were between 40 and 50 mg/g of liver. The assay of cytochrome P-450 in liver homogenate is accurate enough to calculate a reproducible recovery factor. The value of the method lies in its rapidity, its capacity to correct over a wide range of losses, and its capacity to yield reliable values of the total microsomal protein mass. The limits of this method include overestimation of homogenate cytochrome P-450 and inability to correct for nonmicrosomal protein contamination. Overestimation of cytochrome P-450 can be corrected by measuring the difference in absorbance between 450 and 510 nm with the extinction coefficient of 100 mM-1cm-1. To be accurate, cytochrome P-450 determination on microsomes must be done at protein concentrations of about 3 mg/ml. The error inherent to the method may be kept constant and minimal.

In addition to a peak corresponding to native hPL (Kav = 0.39) and one in the void volume, a consistent peak which eluted before hPL (Kav = 0.20) was present. The latter represented 2-25% of total hormonal activity and could be rerun without significant conversion to hPL. In 8M urea, the peak continued to behave as a large molecular weight form on both Sephadex chromatography and on polyacrylamide disc gel electrophoresis. Extraction procedures at both neutral and alkaline pH produced similar quantities of the larger material. [125I]iodo-hPL was not converted to the larger form by the conditions of extraction or analysis. These properties are consistent with a larger molecular weight, non-aggregated form of hPL. In comparison with the native hormone, the idsplacement curves for the larger form were parallel in radioimmunoassay studies.

{"_id": "1247", "description": "The conformational oscillation of delta-chymotrypsin involvement of methionine-192.. In delta-chymotrypsin the reactivity of methionine-192 towards p-nitrophenacyl bromide is strongly reduced when the alpha-amino group of isoleucine-16 has been acetylated. Since acetylation of isoleucine-16 brings delta-chymotrypsin to a conformation similar to its alkaline one this suggests that methionine-192 should present an impaired reactivity in the alkaline conformation of the protein. It is indeed observed that its chemical reactivity as a function of pH depends on the ionization state of the alpha-amino group of isoleucine-16 (pKapp 9 at 15 degrees C) as does the structure of the enzyme. Reciprocally, after chemical reaction of methionine-192 with hydrogen peroxide, isoleucine-16 presents a slower rate of reaction with fluorescamine than when methionine-192 is free. As a result of methionine-192 oxidation the apparent pK of the alkaline transition is shifted from 9 to about 11 at 15 degrees C. This is reflected in the disappearance of the lag phase previously observed for the initial activity of the enzyme when it is incubated at alkaline pH [Eur. J. Biochem. (1973) 39,293-300]. The absence of chemical reactivity of methionine-192 in the alkaline state of the enzyme is confirmed by the appearance of a lag phase in the reaction of the protein with iodoacetate after an incubation at alkaline pH. Such a lag phase does not appear when this incubation is carried out at neutral pH. Since this lag phase is similar to that which shows up in the activity during the isomerization of the enzyme from its alkaline to its neutral state, the present data are interpreted as implying a concerted movement of isoleucine-16 and methionine-192 during this isomerization process. They also indicate that in the alkaline form of the enzyme methionine-192 has moved back into the interior of the protein. Since the spectroscopic properties of the zymogen and of the high-pH form of the enzyme are similar they suggest that methionine-192 occupies in the alkaline conformation of the enzyme a similar position as it does in the zymogen."}

It is tentatively proposed that the rate-limiting step at saturating concentrations of CO2 or HCO3 is an intramolecular proton transfer between two ionizing groups in the active site. It cannot be decided whether the transformation between enzyme-bound CO2 and HCO3 involves a proton trnasfer or not."}
{"_id": "1250", "description": "Purification and properties of isoenzymes of cinnamyl-alcohol dehydrogenase from soybean-cell-suspension cultures.. Two isoenzymes of an NADP+ -dependent cinnamyl alcohol dehydrogenase and an NAD+ - dependent aliphatic alcohol dehydrogenase were extracted from cell suspension cultures of soybean (Glycine max L., var. Mandarin) which form lignin during growth. These enzymes could be separated from each other by chromatography on DEAE-cellulose and hydroxyapatite. The cinnamyl alcohol dehydrogenase isoenzymes were partially purified by (NH4)2SO4 fractionation, and column chromatography on DEAE-cellulose, Sephadex G-100, and hydroxyapatite. The molecular weight of the enzymes were estimated by the elution volumes from a Sephadex G-100 column and were found to be about 43,000 (isoenzyme 1) and 69,000 (isoenzyme 2). Maximum rates of reaction were observed in the case of coniferyl alcohol oxidation at pH 9.2 (Isoenzyme 1) and pH 8.8 (isoenzyme 2); in the reverse reaction pH 6.5 was optimal for isoenzyme 2. Whereas isoenzyme 1 is specific for coniferyl alcohol, isoenzyme 2 can also oxidize cinnamyl alcohol and a number of substituted cinnamyl alcohols, Km values for substituted cinnamaldehydes are 3-11 times lower than for the corresponding alcohols. Neither isoenzyme reacted with benzyl alcohol, anisic alcohol or ethanol. Substrate inhibition for the forward and reverse reaction was found with isoenzyme 2 but not with isoenzyme 1. The equilibrium constant was determined to be about 10(9) in favour of coniferaldehyde reduction. The possible role of the cinnamyl alcohol dehydrogenase in lignin biosynthesis is discussed."}
{"_id": "1251", "description": "The pyruvate-dehydrogenase complex from Azotobacter vinelandii. 2. Regulation of the activity.. The presence of activators(AMP and sulphate) or inhibitors(acetyl-CoA) has no influence on the Hill coefficient of the S-shaped [pyruvate]--velocity curve of either the pyruvate-NAD+ overall reaction(h equals 2.5) or that of the pyruvate-K3Fe(CN)6 ACTIVITY OF THE FIRST ENZYME (H EQUALs 1.3). pH STUDIES INDICATED THAT THE Hill coefficient is dependent on subunit ionization within the pyruvate-containing complex and not on those in the free complex. It is concluded that pyruvate conversion rather that pyruvate binding is responsible for the allosteric pattern. The activity is due to absence of a protein kinase, mainly regulated at the acetyl-CoA/CoA, and NADH/NAD+ levels and by the value of the energy charge."}
